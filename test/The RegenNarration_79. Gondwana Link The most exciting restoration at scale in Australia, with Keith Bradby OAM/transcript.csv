22,en-US,413.1899904,16.08,Um I guess don't want to link is a concept and a vision and now a program that that grew out of you know the earlier great efforts to come to terms with where we were living I mean we're we're in the top end of the Oyster Harbor catchment,0.93,1.0

28,en-US,522.6500096,20.8800256,And to do that we took a deep breath and said well the old evolutionary pathway is from the wet to the dry and back again depending on what the climate does West Coast south west forests Um Can we connect them up through this part of the world and right out into the the arid woodlands and virtually to the,0.97,1.0

31,en-US,576.5599744,21.9300352,Well the first step was to go about it There's been no great bloody expenditure and time lost on detailed planning and that it's pretty simple You've got a few main habitat gaps you've got to start filling in So mainly driven or led might be the better phrase mainly led by private money Um securing some of these quite marginal,0.96,1.0
32,en-US,598.4900096,22.949990399999997,farms out further and discovering the art of ecological restoration in this landscape How do we do it across you know thousands of hectares Um We started doing that It started building its own momentum We worked with the people of the east in the what's now known as the great western woodlands,0.99,1.0
33,en-US,622.070016,14.489958399999999,We work with the people in the forest And I guess the the essence of Uh what I'm hovering around there is that There's only a few of us at the core of only three and a half people That's a almost a doubling from when we started,0.98,1.0
34,en-US,637.1899903999999,17.580032,But there's you know Um dozens and dozens of dozens of people and you know 20 30 40 organizations doing bits of the league So our role is to to wave that flag of the big vision to to try and help people think more strategically to fill critical gaps,0.96,1.0
35,en-US,655.0900224,23.0199808,And just to give the encouragement that the Um encouragement and support that the private conservation groups like the Friends of Program say it don't get much And that's such an important role and clearly is working here It's often a role that doesn't get itself the support it needs,0.98,1.0
36,en-US,678.4500224,16.7000064,No Uh but you've managed to have success doing that Well you know the program's 18 years old it's still growing I'd have liked to have been finished by now Yes But we're hanging in there And I think Uh I think it's moving at all,0.96,1.0
37,en-US,697.4500352,19.830016,Um And and we survive the coal program trying to survive by the skin of its teeth And it's a bit precarious You can you know one of the one of the things I think the the Landcare and conservation environment world suffers from is death by a thousand projects,0.98,1.0
38,en-US,717.7900032,15.809996799999999,There's always a grant somewhere that you can work your box off to get a bit of money for and carry out But very little funding for the corps organizing And a lot of what we do we call the invisible work you know,0.97,1.0
39,en-US,733.7800192,14.490009599999999,And indeed it's a bit like marriage broking You can get that Um investor over there and that community group there and that and there and this Mother Uh Nature over here And if you can get them to come together then yeah I'll do it,0.95,1.0
40,en-US,748.9299967999999,14.6699776,But it does take Um that take a fair bit of time and and effort and so on to do that Like a lot of groups that core operating dollar is the critical one And when you've got that your leverage is massive,0.95,1.0
41,en-US,764.0499712,18.3600128,You know you can bring in far more than you will ever cost Yeah And you failed what you have found conversely in inspiring people It's with a sense of place I guess these universal values They really Um they really inspire and they really fascinate me,0.98,1.0
42,en-US,782.7999744,17.460019199999998,What bridges people What connects people you know to the goal of your work connecting people up It's seems to be on passion for place And then I guess the spark of seeing success is is that right Yes Um I mean different people are inspired by different things,0.96,1.0
43,en-US,800.7100416,17.9099648,So being responsive to that and not trying to draft people down down our particular right Um direction but being a bit creative about all they really want to do that And oh well actually if I did that in this way with those guys you know that sort of stuff,0.94,1.0
44,en-US,819.2500223999999,19.830016,But but your cool premise there Um People don't get that inspired by the domy gloomy outlook that in reality is in front of us Uh Yes Yep I've got it You know the world's going to bloody hell in a handbasket and it's all grim,0.93,1.0
45,en-US,839.5900416,14.2099456,But I'm not going to dwell on that Um What's that Graham ski the The old anarchist said something like Um pessimism of the intellect optimism of the will And Um you know if if we're going to go down I'm going to go down fighting,0.96,1.0
46,en-US,853.8400256,20.1800192,Hmm And as you say that and then you start acting well amazingly good things do happen And Um we know where we're making a fundamental difference We know these beautiful bits of Bush like this Hey it it could have easily been turned into a salty barren paetec like the bit next door that was cleared,0.92,1.0
47,en-US,874.919936,24.450048,And it's full of life full of birds and stuff So that keeps people going and brings them together The sense of place One is interesting Um You know it's we got our our kick off in life through some of the large groups Nature Conservancy in particular you know a global environmental group Um who could see the potential,0.97,1.0
48,en-US,899.3699839999999,18.0900864,And you know it's probably still better than most Australians that this is the biodiversity hotspot of the country So what the hell can we do here It's so important Hmm Um And that was the kick off But I I'm increasingly the sustenance that keeps us going,0.94,1.0
49,en-US,917.7900032,19.0199808,The the energy on the ground and the continuity is with Uh the local people and the local group too This is a place they're not going anywhere I know you get knocked around Um And increasingly more of our work is about Um how do you help them scale up,0.96,1.0
50,en-US,937.110016,16.5000192,And that's that's not necessarily a small thing to some of them but there's a lot of ambition in the community But I think there's another sense of place coming into play I mean you know there is a Uh global sense of place Um emerging in more and more people,0.98,1.0
51,en-US,953.6100352,18.480025599999998,So in the last months we've been talking with three people who are looking at securing properties and restoring them Two of them are in Sydney I'm sorry what's going on here Same as I say I feel the planetary commitment and the need to do something local,0.99,1.0
52,en-US,972.9600512,21.929983999999997,And I look around at where that can be most effectively done And you add to that the element of a degree of success that we've got a track record We've shown that the change can happen that you can get a pretty good semblance of Bush back into a bare paddock Um and do it with the community support and,0.98,1.0
53,en-US,995.7600256,13.1899392,they look around the country and ring us up True Love it And then you match those sort of people up with these locals who had the continuity and the incredible depth of knowledge It's a it's a nice recipe,0.97,1.0
54,en-US,1008.9599999999999,22.4999424,Yeah And you're finding that the transformation's then can be pretty quick or quicker than you might have expected Yeah And and time and time is of the essence Yes And I think if you try and do these sort of programs through you know your standard operating model you know he used to say these are the and well,0.96,1.0
55,en-US,1031.4599424,16.2299904,No One it's too bloody expensive Um Number two is not quite sure what it's doing And number three it doesn't work and it doesn't work as well as as what is effectively a viral spread You know time is of the essence,0.98,1.0
56,en-US,1047.699968,14.8401152,You can't do these you can't make these changes through hierarchical structures or agencies or that it's it's a you know the people on the ground who say oh look at that I hadn't thought of doing Let's do that,0.98,1.0
57,en-US,1062.5400832,18.4199168,And you know you blink and they've done it That adds to the excitement Yeah And it is selfish Yeah Yeah it's really interesting I've had a couple of guests on the podcast Uh use metaphors like it's like a microbial network organized like the microbiome or the other one,0.96,1.0
58,en-US,1081.0799104,12.6601216,I think it was Nicole Masters That was that Bush I think and Nicole Masters said Uh like mycelial network Yeah Yeah When they organize like that that's the way nature works That is the way nature works Why do we think we can,0.9,1.0
59,en-US,1094.3100928,21.4499328,A better arrangement And look the fundamental lesson of this book is that Uh you know diversity and adaptability That's the story here And if you can put that into Uh a Uh rough organizational structure and that's where it is it's just a Uh highly cohesive like a mycelium or whatever you like,0.94,1.0
60,en-US,1116.3000832,15.8399488,And it's not that different from from hell or another not you and other people would have organized themselves You know I think we've we started to shake off that Um that Western arrogance and think oh hang on a minute that's not working that well,0.96,1.0
61,en-US,1132.4999679999999,18.2600704,Let's look around for the other models of behavior When you see the footage that you've put together in a film or two of the clearing that happened here and the vigor with Which had happened When you talk about the old arrogant mindset that you know on the one hand it of course is painful to watch it,0.97,1.0
62,en-US,1150.7699711999999,16.2500608,It was so recent if only we didn't But on the other hand you go well if we're not remotely Well a lot of us aren't remotely thinking like that anymore So it does seem to be indicative of the movement I guess in our culture,0.98,1.0
63,en-US,1167.2399871999999,18.7400192,Hip Yep I mean I'm Uh Oh you really start number one Uh You know we do we do dran ourselves in our current situation our worries And this is Yeah but Chip look back to a bit of backtracking and Um Yeah a friend knew our friends,0.87,0.99

65,en-US,1199.9398912,25.6601088,Yeah And for a society this society to have gone from Proudly knocking over and plowing in a million acres a year Um 30 or 40 50 years ago to start to standard all back up again I mean the people we work with who've cleared their farm and then had and proudly farm it but have had a bit of,0.91,1.0
66,en-US,1225.6,12.1800704,an oh shit moment about oh I think we are all gone Look look what's happening to the creek Oh dear Look what's oh my soils aren't doing what I used to do and Um where those rains that used to come in around the house,0.93,1.0
67,en-US,1238.3499264,20.6000128,And you know how do we how do we move the dial back to something much more livable I mean what we're at risk of doing particularly If you look at the broader wheatbelt areas what we're at grave risk of doing is is literally having a food factory that not many people want to live in,0.97,1.0
68,en-US,1259.2900095999998,22.949990399999997,You know it's a place that's losing a third of its population every decade and has for a number of decades Um They're holding their own here Um but it's there's lots of smallholders down here I'm not saying we can to smallholders into the wheat belt but this Um lurching towards a production system dominating the landscape and not having all the,0.96,1.0
69,en-US,1282.24,16.079974399999998,other things that give us delight in life And you know Yeah I don't want to do that I don't want to live that life and also don't want to be responsible or in any way complicit in such a lot of evil illusionary vigor and diversity here,0.96,1.0
70,en-US,1298.8299264,18.9300736,Yeah Um And that in our lifetimes a lot of that's happened Yeah but that's the doom and gloom shit We don't we just recognize that the future is a positive change that is is occurring and and OK it's not occurring anywhere near fast enough but it's a pretty good foundation to build off,0.96,1.0
71,en-US,1317.8500096,19.800064,Yeah Let's talk some successes if perhaps speaking of old cultures living cultures than no One up story If I could talk about the nudger story as well But let's start with the nowon up story Well you know and I've been quite a voyage of discovery for us in that,0.92,1.0
72,en-US,1338.7400192,16.7399424,It was Uh one of the first properly secured Premiere general farming area And you know the fact that it's got 50 hundred foot high cliffs and breakaways all over it suggests it wasn't a flesh cropping property We bought it for its ecological value though,0.9,1.0
73,en-US,1355.6600832,17.7299456,Those it's got a number of the local endemic and rarer plants on it But it's also a connector between a main Creek Valley opinio and Uh nature reserve And that same year we were thinking oh yeah we're doing this stuff,0.93,1.0
74,en-US,1373.3900288,16.019968,And we were securing land And Uh yeah we don't know that country So what's the decent thing to do And Um talk to a few elders reintroduced ourselves to the magnificent Ujjain AIDS and just went out there on a trip with elders initially,0.91,1.0
75,en-US,1389.8000384,11.439923199999999,Now Uh I just got to mention about that trip I mean We we built I was the lucky bloke who got out here in the woods in the car in the front seat with me as we drove up and,0.94,1.0
76,en-US,1402.4899584,20.7300608,It was a pretty useful reminder on how I live this landscape can be a flag and also just strolling through some of the paddocks and Um every 100 200 meters she had a story Yeah You know I'm from her life and from her knowledge and I'm not necessarily saying you know traditional stories going way back,0.92,1.0
77,en-US,1423.2200192,13.4699008,But you know this is where your uncle did that and you see that tree over there What happened there And I thought there was a lovely trip and we get to mount up And we basically just agreed Well this is your country guides,0.95,1.0
78,en-US,1437.3499904,15.649996799999998,Oh we haven't got a gate any more Excellent Are you guys going to make use of it And ingraining Australia Who's the legal owner of the property We're very much part of this And and you know we the voyage of Discovery Ujjain consulted with elders,0.9,1.0
79,en-US,1453.0100224,16.9399296,I made a few trips there on their own and decided I would build a meeting place for The nuclear engineering Modula people white people where we could all meet and talk and work things out And this program just sort of organically grew,0.92,1.0
