81,en-US,1695.2399871999999,20.1901056,How does how does a building influence our Um our Uh our natural surrounding How does it influence our ecosystem Um How does it Uh how are we combining nature with our building So I think there are a lot of different Uh different realities than two to what,0.97,1.0
82,en-US,1715.4300928,19.2898048,Whatever you built I think Hatari summed it up very well in his books when he was talking about those fictional stories that that Uh people invented Yeah Um Um And they are somehow ruling us all a day to day life Right like fictional stories like money or Um or nations,0.94,1.0
83,en-US,1734.9498879999999,16.560128,So so this is this is not an objective reality right Yeah Because Uh because we invented them and because they are somehow guiding all of our economic system Um So we build a lot for this But actually our planet does not really care about those things,0.95,1.0
84,en-US,1751.6699648,20.9999872,Yeah So there are bigger realities that architects Uh need to take care of Um So I think this you know these layers of reality I think Uh Well I think a lot about those Uh Ladya And how do you how do you see sort of one determining what that that primary reality is,0.98,1.0
85,en-US,1772.669952,24.510054399999998,And how do you push Uh let's say your client to see that perspective of let's address that reality that you know what we're trying to target And those are very different difficult Uh points to address them Right because of course a client has a different reality of what he wants to get out of a project,0.98,1.0
86,en-US,1797.5400447999998,18.3300096,But that doesn't necessarily mean that Um we are not allowed to think about Uh utopia or to have Uh utopian ideas in our work So we in our studio we somehow address it a little bit different So we work always on two projects at the same time,0.99,1.0
87,en-US,1816.5600256,14.340095999999999,Um We never work on more projects and we try not to work on this project So one of those two projects is always coming from the client side So this one is financing Uh our office Uh project deals with restrictions we have with compromises,0.96,1.0
88,en-US,1830.909952,17.710079999999998,So Um everything that Uh you know connects with the kind of teamwork for reality Um But Uh We always then also have a self initiated project to work on So those are projects that Uh do not have a client They are not paid by anyone,0.93,1.0
89,en-US,1848.6200319999998,16.3500032,So they are self financed as well Um And they we try to think a little bit more utopians of what topics of the future that Uh that we as architects need to address And maybe at a certain point once we publish them they can turn into a business,0.96,1.0
90,en-US,1865.7800192,14.8799488,Um So we might try Uh we might find some clients So we did that before Uh with a couple of projects For example all of our bambu projects Um have been that way So we worked for two years Um on those projects and we financed it by ourselves,0.96,1.0
91,en-US,1880.9899008,14.790041599999999,And once we've published it we found two or three clients then who wanted to build them Um So in that way we turned it into a reality Um And maybe that Uh that puts the business side of architecture on a bit of a different level,0.98,1.0
92,en-US,1895.8198783999999,17.9300352,And I think well as architects we also need to to think about Uh about this idea Hmm You're you're kind of you have a tight constraint then if you're looking at you know one project that's sort of financing you and then the second project is explorative,0.98,1.0
93,en-US,1914.619904,17.640038399999998,Are you guys just living on tight means to to make this structure work or is it Uh you know kind of supplement it by books and Uh speaking engagements and that sort of thing You don't earn a lot of speaking engagements,0.97,1.0
94,en-US,1934.1500416,14.5000448,Um No Uh I mean we Uh we think that a little bit different of the business side Um So we downsized a lot Uh So we have we have now like my wife and me we are leading the office and we have two employees and that's our whole team,0.98,1.0
95,en-US,1948.669952,14.4300032,So I try very hard to keep it as small as possible because Um that gives me as an architect also a lot of freedom so I can decide for example and which projects I want to work on I don't have to say yes to everything,0.98,1.0
96,en-US,1963.4300928,18.599936,And the ability as an architect to say no to certain projects Uh is the biggest freedom Um I could have ever asked for because it also puts you on a much Uh different level when it comes to negotiations about fees about Uh projects in general Um that you have the ability to just say no,0.99,1.0
97,en-US,1982.2700544,16.859955199999998,And at the moment I think we say no to around 90 percent or so of all income in projects And we really just take someone one off who fits Uh our vision Um but also Um who of course need to pay for Uh for for all the expenses we have,0.95,1.0
98,en-US,1999.490048,18.4498176,But I think in when we were in Beijing I had a much different Um a different idea of what success means as an architect Um Uh Like we had a large team Um back then in Beijing Um And I I you know I wanted to grow our business,0.98,1.0
99,en-US,2017.9398655999998,19.4101248,I wanted to grow the number of employees I wanted to grow the amount of projects Uh we are getting in Um And I also wanted to grow to the importance of the projects Um But I somehow Uh you know somehow discovered that it just was mainly writing emails anymore,0.97,1.0
100,en-US,2037.5400447999998,15.229951999999999,And Uh and Simon Kleidi client meetings But I really missed the thing What I really love to do Um and this is like designing and working on the computer on projects by myself as well Right Yeah Um I missed that part of architecture,0.97,1.0
101,en-US,2053.040128,19.8299648,And once we moved back Um I know that I had to change Uh some parts And I discovered that actually success is Uh is a matter of definition Um Before you know maybe you wanted to be Um an influential architects Uh architect Uh with a lot of projects,0.96,1.0
102,en-US,2072.8700928,22.319923199999998,And so but Uh now I discovered that actually I don't want to be necessarily a successful architect Uh nor do I want to be a famous architect So I rich architects I would be Uh happy architect And I think this is Uh this is really important decisions we make that Uh we don't necessarily need to make a lot of growth in our,0.98,1.0
103,en-US,2095.190016,17.4598144,office but we define success successful Uh to to be happy with what we are doing And as long as we can Uh you know support Uh our family with it And I'm pleased with this then I think we on the right Uh path to do it Um because now we have much more passion for the project to work on,0.96,1.0
104,en-US,2113.189888,23.850188799999998,Yeah And that's Uh that's kind of the direction that I think a lot of people Uh younger architects kind of our generation I think we're the same age Um 34 35 ish Uh Yeah Uh I think that's kind of the direction that everyone wants to go is more of I want to be a happy architect not necessarily a stressed out name on,0.99,1.0
105,en-US,2137.0400768,18.2398976,the on the Building Uh you know grow to 300 plus employee type person or company Yeah and I think maybe it's also not I think we are a very different generation from the generations who came before us That's for sure,0.99,1.0
106,en-US,2155.7198848,21.0300928,I think everything we do we try to find a meaning Uh with it Um It's Uh it's not so much anymore that we necessarily want to make Uh a standpoint or that we need to Um need to have our opinions heard but Uh maybe to find work that really makes a difference and and has a meaning,0.98,1.0
107,en-US,2177.92,18.450022399999998,Um And Uh I think this this era of the architect says this master Um who you know who who who is is famous and newspapers And so I think this era is a little bit over And I think we have more living in an era of collaboration and Uh teamwork,0.92,1.0
108,en-US,2196.5000704,17.1999232,So Yeah Yeah And that's the That's kind of where I am as well Uh I came to this realization that no matter how much work I put out it's a very small percentage that I'm providing to affect the world,1.0,1.0
109,en-US,2215.1999487999997,19.3501184,Um So I think you want to go for quality of what you do And I switched to wanting to do this podcast in part to hopefully impact more Um So it's not necessarily just the the individual work that I put out but maybe the ideas that I can share,0.99,1.0
110,en-US,2234.5601024,17.0600448,And I think that's the direction that you're going with your explorative work is the you know solving problems in a different way and inspiring people And then hopefully you can build it which turns into something else Uh for a lot that a lot of other architects to to imitate or spread,0.97,1.0
111,en-US,2252.7299583999998,17.7000448,Um Is that kind of how you see Uh it also has been a side effect Right I mean we are Um we are still young Young architects And this is a very weird place to to be in because as an architect you you mainly get very good when you are in your 60s and 70s right,0.93,1.0
112,en-US,2270.459904,18.719948799999997,Yeah So I think but but I think we are living in a time which is very has a very short attention span and everything needs to happen immediately So Um But Uh if you if you define success not necessarily by growing or Um or by Uh or making a lot of profit,0.99,1.0
113,en-US,2289.1798528,16.3702784,And so then I think you have more time to breathe in between you know to to go like it is in my case to go to nature or be on the mountain things like Right And this also keeps maybe the passioned and longer life that when you are in your prime time in your 60s or in the,0.97,1.0
114,en-US,2305.5599616,17.880064,70s as an architect you still have the necessary passion to to work on projects Uh So I think this Um this notion of Uh of work life balance it's not just for your immediate life but it's also to keep the balance in Um life for for a much longer term,0.96,1.0
115,en-US,2323.9499776,24.179916799999997,Um I'm fully aware that architecture is not Um it's not the sprint but Uh a long marathon Exactly Um A lot of teachers are not teachers A lot of people that you know that are ahead in career Um that I've come across have always said while I was in school and after school you know really cherish the time you have in school,0.98,1.0
116,en-US,2348.1298944,15.250022399999999,because you won't be able to do this out in the real world And what you're doing is saying why not I can still do this and explore and do crazy things Uh Not necessarily that someone has to finance it right away but I can continue this,1.0,1.0
117,en-US,2363.820032,21.4499328,Yeah And this is this is also a very weird thing right Because Um it was somehow a little bit similar I see it as a lot in architects that Um you have so much passion when you're studying architecture You can work all night long and do two nightshifts Uh without ends because you have so much Uh fun working on your projects,0.97,1.0
118,en-US,2385.2699648,19.260006399999998,But then when you're starting with the business and you are you are thrown into reality then this passion can sink enormously And I think these are a lot of problems that our industry has you know like with pressure with Uh Uh with this Um Um with this notion that we you know we have deadlines and Uh we need to change things before,0.98,1.0
119,en-US,2404.5299712,19.3499136,a deadline and stuff like this Right Yeah Um But Uh but that's really weird because architecture in reality is also so beautiful You're finally Um allowed to turn your ideas into reality And actually the the passion you have for architecture should grow by that and not get minimized,0.97,1.0
120,en-US,2424.5399552,26.1900288,Um Um So it's really weird Uh in a way And Uh I think it's in our generation to rethink a little bit of what we are doing and how we are doing it Yeah definitely So going back to the exploration side of your business Um what are the two two to three kind of top concerns that you guys are Um looking at as,0.98,1.0
121,en-US,2450.820096,18.7400192,solving as an architect Um or that architects should be trying to solve some Um concerns I think Um I think I would I would have two major ones I think one is Uh the ecological downfall I think that architects Uh need a dress,0.93,1.0
122,en-US,2469.5701504,16.979968,And the second one is Uh the rise of technology Um I think the the the ecological problem I think that like we are in a generation where the climate change is not anymore Uh a theoretical possibility Right But it's reality for us,0.98,1.0
123,en-US,2486.909952,22.8501504,Um And I think it's also now in every Um architect's Uh job description that we need to find some solutions for that Um And Uh but you know I mentioned before that that sometimes it's very difficult to to say what is reality Um And that sometimes our realities is based in those fictional stories,0.98,1.0
124,en-US,2509.9999232,18.99008,But so was architecture all the time Right So we built somehow we built like the pyramids for some gods Uh We also built like the costs of some some political system like kings and queens Um we built Uh Now we're building mainly for and for an economic system,0.93,1.0
125,en-US,2528.9900032,14.850048,Right Uh In order to make developers money So we designed a lot for for those fictional stories as well They shaped somehow us as architects in our work Um But you know our planet does not really care for that Right,0.96,1.0
126,en-US,2544.0100352,17.8300928,And Uh the ecology side of our planet will Um you know has been a downfall because of that and Um what we are doing the building industry has a big impact Uh on Like for example climate change or pollution We produce like 40 percent of all the CO2,0.97,1.0
127,en-US,2562.7099135999997,20.9399808,Um We use more than 50 percent of the world's energy So it has a lot of impact of how we design and what we are doing And I think some Uh Um as architects we also have a responsibility to think how we can work on more ecological alternatives Uh of our of our building Um industry,0.98,1.0
128,en-US,2584.1999871999997,26.5699328,Um You know I lived for five years in China Um I lived in Beijing So I know what pollution can do to your health but pollution Um Um Uh can can do to your body Um So and yeah maybe our work You know we we are not our specifically but our generation's work Um is not any more Um guided by some some stylus or Uh or,0.95,1.0
129,en-US,2610.8000256,22.4100352,some Uh some forms or some academic theories And so maybe Um the work for our generation is based on on topics like climate change pollution Um artificial intelligence Uh technology Um and all of this And this based more and is objective reality and not any more in those fictional stories,0.94,1.0
130,en-US,2634.4699904,20.9698816,Um And the second concern Uh but maybe concern is a bit Uh is a bit too much But I'm very thinking a lot about technology And I hope I find the the the correct balance of words that I can can describe a little bit in this Um a little bit in this balance between concern but also Uh have a big interest in,0.98,1.0
131,en-US,2655.439872,23.130112,this Right What technology Uh will do Um to to our future Um So I think that the the ecological system always needs that Uh Uh The economic system always needs value Right Uh And the technology system always needs data Um to be measured But technology needs to measure everything,0.98,1.0
132,en-US,2678.5699839999997,20.7900672,And in order to measure something we need it needs to create perfect conditions around us Um So for example everyone who who works with the computer knows exactly how it is Right Uh that a computer it's very Uh easy to create perfect things but it's very difficult to create imperfect things for example,0.98,1.0
133,en-US,2699.5400704,21.8998784,It's very easy to create a perfect world but it's very difficult to create leaves lying around Uh on the street Um And I think this is with a lot Uh of things For example in in the city we create parks Uh but we make them so perfect that Um it's you know we are not allowed anymore to go on the grasslands Um or,0.96,1.0
134,en-US,2722.429952,28.4899328,Uh without building in similar Adobe We create perfect buildings that are highly efficient Um and are highly measurable by data How much and that CDG was Um how productive they are Um But we have Ketzel when to open our windows Uh Um So I think that all of this Um this Uh drive to towards perfection somehow kills this beautiful Uh sense of imperfection in our life,0.95,1.0
135,en-US,2750.92992,17.160192,And you know as human beings we are wonderfully imperfect So I think the the best stories in our life happened when perfection Uh takes a break Yeah Um So some somehow you know we grow our food for example Adobe our own food in our house,0.94,1.0
136,en-US,2768.090112,17.279999999999998,And the the the nicest tomatoes are the ones which somehow shaped like a heart Uh like Ilunga or something Right Um Or Uh like my wife will run I think it was in Prague I saw and we got lost Uh because both of our mobile phones didn't work,0.91,1.0
137,en-US,2785.3998079999997,18.210201599999998,Yeah Um So we we found this little cafe Uh somewhere Um and Uh it was probably not the nicest cafe But somehow we we remembered it Uh Uh so passionately Right that it's in Uh Uh Rain so somehow this this imperfection that we didn't know where we are,0.92,1.0
138,en-US,2803.8201344,20.9098752,Let us find this really personal spot and this created a personal connection to something And but I fear if Um if this if technology and maybe artificial intelligence in 20 years Um is Um guiding the way how we work we lose a lot of this imperfect Uh things in our buildings,0.96,1.0
139,en-US,2824.7300096,18.0299776,So Um we lose for example to the connection to our senses We lose the connection to nature Uh and all of this little imperfection that Uh that we really cherish Um So I'm a little bit concerned what technology will do but I'm also very interested in how it goes,0.96,1.0
140,en-US,2843.1800319999998,21.3600256,It goes forward Um Yeah One of my Uh things with that on the technology front is that I think it's going to free up and completely shift the way that we work Uh So a lot more people who work from home and potentially you can build in that connection to nature and be able to work from the park or you,0.99,1.0
141,en-US,2864.5400575999997,20.429824,know kind of free you up in that sense Um So that's the kind of plus side in my perspective Hopefully I mean it's very difficult to predict what technology will do Right So if the invention of the computer the prediction enough of the future of us Um the main problem of future civilization will be that we will be too,0.96,1.0
142,en-US,2884.9698816,18.9001728,bored So this was to predict Right And I think we have many problems in our civilization Uh But boredom is none of them Yeah I think we under stress level that has never been before Right So yes Uh like supposedly technology should free up a lot of space for a sense should take over a lot of tasks you don't,0.97,1.0
143,en-US,2903.8700544,21.6600576,want to do But you know history proves that it also could go definitely in a different site Right Yeah Um Yeah So it's very hard to predict what Uh technology will do But I think that as architects no matter if Uh if this one how how large the influence of technology will have and the way we design them and the,0.97,1.0
144,en-US,2925.530112,21.5699456,way how our buildings operate I think we try to meet Uh we need to try to find Um still some spaces for this imperfection and for spaces that really connects to our senses that we don't lose Uh lose the sense of how things smell and how things Uh how things Uh feel,0.98,1.0
145,en-US,2947.8201344,21.509939199999998,And yeah exactly So Um yeah I think whatever we do we should try to create spaces Uh to to still keep Uh the connection to our senses Yeah To definitely pull people out Uh to enjoy and to like you said feel touch smell Um or see,0.98,1.0
146,en-US,2969.5700991999997,26.4900608,And Uh because I think we're overstimulated with technology in that sense Uh there's too much information So try and design to attract people to to go explore and experience Uh other things besides the computer Yeah So where where are you guys that own population as as one of those concerns issues,0.96,1.0
147,en-US,2996.0699904,18.860032,Because that's kind of been on my mind On top of that I just Uh just saw Uh the I don't know if you're into Um Marvel Uh Infinity Wars and Endgame and all of that Not necessarily in the sense of capping population but dealing with population and population growth,0.98,1.0
148,en-US,3015.7701119999997,16.7299072,I mean the predictions are right that Uh we will flatten out at a certain point like a 10 billion people or so Uh We will flatten Um the question And this one if our resources are better addressed Um I think that's it,0.98,1.0
149,en-US,3032.5100543999997,20.3999232,Our planet is able to handle that Um But I think that Uh Um that well growth of course is a problem Population growth is a problem But I think the bigger problem is the economic strife are growing economically constantly Um And you know of distribution of how of the wealth,0.98,1.0
150,en-US,3053.6298496,16.5001216,Um I think this is a much bigger problem than Uh than than population growth But Uh while the predictions are like Uh 10 billion people we will Uh will be on the on the earth and the planet then by 2050 or so and 70 percent of them will live in cities,0.95,1.0
151,en-US,3070.2901248,21.389721599999998,And so that's that's very good You know on an architectural point of view because we won't run out of Uh projects Yeah Um But uh you know if we continue building like we do and could use so much Uh so much waste so much Uh CO2 Um cetera Um then this will become a very big problem,0.96,1.0
152,en-US,3091.6999167999998,23.700070399999998,So I think it is also on us and us architects of how we Uh we we build differently or how Try to find ecological alternatives to help rebuild Yeah because I'm sort of Um self educating now on Uh the psychology Uh environmental psychology and some studies show although they were done on rats,0.96,1.0
153,en-US,3116.4499968,20.9399808,Uh Studies show that you know when you get a denser population in a confined area you subsequently have poorer environments Um which is what we see is pollution and Um run down of of the streets and utilities and et cetera Uh Bad living conditions,0.97,1.0
154,en-US,3137.6001023999997,16.029695999999998,So I think as a industry we need to be very aware Uh hyper aware and vigilant about you know preparing for that and developing coming up with ideas exploring now like you guys are doing Uh How do we solve that,1.0,1.0
155,en-US,3153.6498687999997,25.4001152,What do we do to introduce nature into that environment How do we provide privacy Uh sound control different things like that to to manage the psyche of individuals while we're bringing so many people into a single location Exactly Uh how how we designing buildings for our well being Um and and that are healthy to us,0.99,1.0
156,en-US,3179.5601407999998,17.0600448,Um And how does this also influence our natural environment that Uh that is that both can somehow live in harmony Right So that's it That's healthy to us as a species But it's also healthy to add a species to to nature to our ecosystem et cetera,0.98,1.0
157,en-US,3196.6699519999997,23.3801728,Yeah Um Do you have any projects that that you guys have either worked on or that you Um sort of look to as inspiration maybe of that address those concerns that you're looking at One one big inspiration is probably the high line Um that's you know like this this Uh reuse of the Highline that it is a stand the way it,0.97,1.0
158,en-US,3220.0501248,24.0797696,was Uh It is now It's actually brought so much change Right But Um it's so that it's not necessarily the correct way to build another building Right And use this space for a developer to make another buck but to introduce Uh nature back into a city that people really enjoy and makes it so successful that it's also Uh an economic success,0.98,1.0
159,en-US,3244.1298944,19.4902016,Right That the real estate Uh Uh next to it Uh is is growing so fast And so I think this is a very good example of how a sense of ecology can also influence the economy that way And both then can grow with each other Um when it comes to technology,0.98,1.0
160,en-US,3263.6299264,14.3699968,I think we were inspired Uh last time we were in Bali We we have we have been at the Green Village Uh which is built by Buku It's all built with bamboo And I think this also shows like what craftsmen can really do,0.98,1.0
161,en-US,3278.2399487999996,22.230016,And I think that's Uh important in an age where Um I might take over in our generation Right Um Like robotics is taking over that the craftsmen can produce Um such a beautiful piece of art Um and Uh that inspires Uh so many people Um with something so rudimentary like bamboo,0.98,1.0
162,en-US,3300.8300031999997,15.3899008,I think that is really beautiful to see Um But of course we are also trying to to work on projects that that go into this topic Um We are living Uh on the mountain Uh like we are growing our own food We have our own garden,0.98,1.0
163,en-US,3316.219904,22.4700416,We are trying to live like as independent as somehow possible Um And I know that not everyone is as fortunate that we are Um but we try to bring those ideas also to the city Um so that people have maybe their space to grow their own vegetables Um to live out tarkus also in the city in the city,0.95,1.0
164,en-US,3339.4700288,19.3501184,Um And that maybe also the way of how we are growing our foods and how our food lands on the table becomes again part of our daily Uh of our daily life that the food is not something that somewhere grows Uh out of our sight and out of our mind but that we somehow bring it back to the center of,0.96,1.0
165,en-US,3358.8201472,18.270003199999998,our lives Um and more in connection of how our food really Uh grows and lands on our table Yeah so so you're thinking designing where you have sort of a farm built into your your own site Um even in your own house maybe,0.98,1.0
166,en-US,3377.5099904,19.2,Or your apartment Yeah exactly Um So we did a concept which is called Uh Uh the farm house which is a skyscraper that has private gardens Um for for the occupants to to grow their own food or Uh to have food grown for a wider surroundings,0.94,1.0
167,en-US,3396.7398912,21.7800704,So this one then can be given out on the first floor Um And it's a kind of a skyscraper that is not an isolated island in the city but somehow connects to its neighborhood Um You know like you see what is happening how the food is growing on the facade Um and then you can buy Uh the food then Uh locally produced,0.97,1.0
168,en-US,3418.5199616,15.36,food Um On the on the lower floors of the building So it somehow connects them Uh with its surrounding And I think this is a beautiful idea because at the moment we have a lot of in the city we have a lot of ivory towers that's not really connected to the surrounding,0.98,1.0
169,en-US,3434.03008,15.6399616,Yeah All glass But you sort of have a vertical farm in that sense Yes exactly But always combined with with living spaces because of course it also needs to be Uh economical profitable for Uh four or five for a developer to build,0.92,1.0
170,en-US,3449.6901119999998,22.2298112,Yes Yeah It's also an incentive for someone that moves in there that they could potentially you know make a little money if they spent the time growing their own farm Yeah exactly Actually the project started Um that we were thinking about Uh about the refugee crisis Um in Europe and how we can build some temporary homes Uh very small sets that,0.99,1.0
171,en-US,3472.1599487999997,17.7000448,on one hand Uh produce Uh like let the people sleep or live in there But under the roof they can grow their own vegetables and Uh maybe sell it to a wider Uh a Uh wider population And this is a first a first step of integration Um and getting to know people,0.96,1.0
172,en-US,3490.6099712,12.840140799999999,Um So yeah we designed it Uh the first day for this purpose And then we thought well this is such a modular system So actually we can also grow it in height and Uh bring this whole concept to the center of our cities,0.95,1.0
173,en-US,3503.7499392,22.3502336,Yeah And the interesting thing about that Um is the natural side of it and how it completely Um gets rid of style sort of And I think you hinted at this a little bit earlier in our conversation of sort of this Uh diminishing stylistic part of architecture,0.99,1.0
174,en-US,3526.490112,20.6598144,How have you seen Uh or what has been your opinion or perception of the evolution of architecture And how are we getting to today of Um sort of not this defined style necessarily anymore Yeah Um Well architecture was always defined Um by style right,0.98,1.0
175,en-US,3547.1798271999996,23.650304,Yeah Um It always had some some rules of beauty Um Some systems to build Uh But the evolution always Uh most of the times came in steps in big contrast to the previous style So for example the Baroque was very different than the Renaissance Um and the modern Um Uh quit with everything that happened before,0.97,1.0
176,en-US,3570.8502015999998,19.9897088,So it always came Uh in big steps Um Uh very in contrast to our own evolution Everything you went from from one to the next step And so but they were always really really small steps They took very very long So I think in architecture the evolution is Uh it's way different but Uh also very excited one,0.95,1.0
177,en-US,3590.8599808,18.5597952,And maybe at the moment we are in this Uh in this stage where we need this next step Um But I think to in order to take this step maybe we don't need again rules of how to make beautiful buildings Uh how to make nice forms of what kind of shapes should define Uh the buildings we are in,0.97,1.0
178,en-US,3609.4898175999997,19.0803968,I think this time is over Um Our generation Um has much bigger challenges to address Um as architects Uh But maybe we need some rules of of ethics and Uh and moral buildings you know that say Um this is nothing new Uh Le Corbusier said it already,0.9,1.0
179,en-US,3628.5702143999997,12.5100032,Right But if you if you build a new building then you take away space from nature Right This was before I Crossland something Yeah but you take away space for nature So find a way of how to give it back in your building,0.95,1.0
180,en-US,3641.16992,21.870182399999997,Yeah The building itself Uh Uh can breathe again Um But also when we are building and you're building in the city we also take away space from a community from a neighborhood Uh So try to find some ways of how Um how we give back to space again to a community Um so that the building is not isolated in the city but it,0.96,1.0
181,en-US,3663.0401024,15.869952,has communal spaces where people can meet and gather Um So maybe we need some of those ethical rules instead of rules of beauty Um I don't know if it's Uh but I think we are at the step now that we should not go forward with the status quo we have in the construction business,0.98,1.0
182,en-US,3679.6297216,20.3403264,Um But we have to rethink it Uh and Uh think of what will be the new steps of the future of our cities Yeah I love that Um moral design Uh We have a big problem right now Uh So on a few fronts I always tell people this story of Uh that,0.99,1.0
183,en-US,3699.9700479999997,20.5799424,I heard of a developer that was building an apartment or something and the architect recommended you know a certain construction for Uh acoustical value And Uh the developer it was too expensive of a construction Uh sense system So they basically said you know what we're not going to do that,0.97,1.0
184,en-US,3720.5798912,23.1002112,And of course a few years later they were sued for sound Uh Uh too much sound transfigure And then everyone was pulled into the lawsuit and you know big mess Uh And then and then you also have situations where Um you know here in Los Angeles we have the the new Rham Stadium going in right smack in the middle of Inglewood,0.97,1.0
185,en-US,3744.0700416,17.6300032,And a lot of people are being gentrified out essentially Uh price Prices are going up Um You know people are buying up their properties to you know tear down and build new homes So everything is going up and all these people in the community are moving out,1.0,1.0
186,en-US,3761.7098751999997,22.5902592,And that stadium you know is really going to be busy Um What's eight nine probably 15 times out of the year Really Um these type of sites how do you open that up to the community that you know maybe you do farmer's markets or something that people can generate income and still live in that community,0.98,1.0
187,en-US,3784.6597632,21.810380799999997,So there's a lot of things that we're you know we need to change the way that we look at and try and figure out a solution in those type of Uh situations to collaborate and be more Yeah Yeah And I mean the the example you mentioned with the guy was that Uh the developer with the soundproofing material got sued,0.97,1.0
188,en-US,3807.1599103999997,16.7698432,Um This is you know this is again because of a very short term thinking Right You want to have the profit as fast as somehow possible to the present Yeah It's all about how how is Uh this dictatorship of the presents Um that everything needs to be as close to the presence,0.96,1.0
189,en-US,3824.1697792,15.540223999999998,Because you don't know what the what in five years or 10 years will be right Yeah Um But I think that the Uh you know if you safe for example if they're a buck that means Uh you know the building might need to get rebuilt in 20 years,0.9,1.0
190,en-US,3839.8898176,20.0699904,Because people also don't care about it Um But if you build Uh the sign that maybe costs 10 percent more in the beginning But that people really care about and to keep it Uh healthy and vital and you know they grow their own food and they really have a personal connection with the architecture that might then stand for 50 or,0.96,1.0
191,en-US,3859.9598079999996,30.0199936,70 years Right And in the end Uh you know that's better for the developer and that is also better for all of the Um ecological aspects Yeah Um So Um do you think architecture is relevant to the public anymore Hmm Uh Uh yeah when when I was in Uh in university like this question was already discussed it almost felt like an AA meeting,0.96,1.0
192,en-US,3890.3701503999996,22.059827199999997,like it's anonymous like where is our impact How can we be important again Uh And things like this A lot of discussions about this topic Um But yeah Um but I think it is relevant right If you look at the numbers like architects involved in about five to eight percent of all buildings built worldwide,0.99,1.0
193,en-US,3912.4500479999997,18.4999936,Right Yeah So that might might Uh sound like you know Ninety five percent of people have stopped listening to us Yeah Um we were busy talking to ourselves Yeah Uh Maybe you know we had for a long time just wrong topics and stuff,0.97,1.0
194,en-US,3931.7999615999997,20.400128,The topics of the day the answers and the quest Uh the questions and the answers to those questions are Uh different different ones than we provide Uh them than what we provide Um So Uh I think like as a as a profession we really have to start Uh listening what is really needed,0.93,1.0
195,en-US,3952.2299903999997,16.3803136,And I think as I said before you know our challenges are as architects are much different ones than than Uh than formal or stylistic Uh Uh Uh questions Um I had a dog I have we have two cats in the in the office,0.93,1.0
196,en-US,3969.3602816,16.19968,They are kind of wildcat So they sleep outside Right And Uh so I built them Uh to cat houses Uh It's like really nicely with woods and even insolated It Uh gives them very soft materials in the inside Uh But they hate it though,0.92,1.0
197,en-US,3986.2501376,19.3798144,Uh They're still they still Uh decided to sleep in this Uh in this minimalistic looking flowerpots Uh maybe because they had good taste on TV because it was just cozy up for them Uh But Uh you know maybe because I didn't listen to it I didn't check what what they really wanted it in Um my architectural ego,0.92,1.0
198,en-US,4005.629952,20.310015999999997,Let me superimpose Uh the desire Right Um I think you know that Uh like Uh it somehow showed me that probably the the most important tool for an architects are Uh the ears And to really listen to what is needed But one night we saw that actually this neighbor cat is a big cat,0.92,1.0
199,en-US,4026.9000704,21.5400448,Um This cat is now sleeping in those houses So maybe I just had the wrong client Yeah Uh So I think we've had the right conversation Like you mentioned architects are a lot Uh future thinkers So we've had the right conversation but at the wrong time,0.98,1.0
200,en-US,4049.3101056,23.369728,And I think that like you said we were talking too much to ourselves And that's the reason I wanted to start this podcast to try and change the conversation a little bit and make it a little more inviting hopefully so that you know people that aren't architects that Uh you know have have some loose interests will pick up,1.0,1.0
201,en-US,4072.6798335999997,18.1501952,a few things and Uh hopefully encourage Um anyone that they come across to think about things a little bit differently Yeah Um Um yeah Uh But the right conversation and like it starts with architectural education Right Like what happens in our universities,0.97,1.0
202,en-US,4090.8300288,14.310195199999999,And I just I could just see from my personal experience when I used to be a student and now I'm teaching again Um like a lot Uh a lot of students are just taught to think like an artist you know to think fully creative,0.96,1.0
203,en-US,4106.3100416,20.129792,Um And Uh that's not necessarily bad But our our job description is much more than than being an artist You know our art is beautiful but Um we are not an artist as architects Um We are much more Uh than an artist We have much more responsibility,0.96,1.0
204,en-US,4127.1300095999995,19.5600384,Uh We live in constant compromise and conversation with other people Nothing can happen without Uh without being a team player or without knowing the business side of things Right So there's much more things than than being just creative steps that plays into architecture,0.99,1.0
205,en-US,4146.9902848,20.969472,But a lot of a little of that Uh at least in my experience is taught in architectural schools Mm hmm Um Yeah So maybe you know maybe that's to to really have Um have the right Uh conversations And you know now with that with with the special and master system that you just study for six semesters or so to to obtain,0.92,0.995
206,en-US,4167.9597568,26.070220799999998,a bachelor's degree Um this is a little bit less time you know to for architects to fully develop Um the skills needed Uh Uh To be an architect Um especially is a lot Very little time to to fail as with your projects to go in wrong directions to get miserable Uh with your ideas and with your designs and then somehow work yourself out,0.98,1.0
207,en-US,4194.0299776,17.400217599999998,of that But failing is something so important Uh for an architectural soul Um to learn and to cope with Uh and and to to cope with it in the in the healthy way Um that you know you know how you get out of it and you know how to make it differently and better,0.97,1.0
208,en-US,4212.0298496,15.8101504,Uh But there is very little time to do that in this education system So Um I think there is there is a lot of maybe we can approve also in this system Uh in our universities in order to to create a better conversation for for what will happen in the future,0.95,1.0
209,en-US,4228.440063999999,27.809791999999998,Yeah No I totally agree with that Um I think you know a lot of students in my experience were pushed that artistic route like you said of Um you know making something beautiful but not necessarily Uh with a reason necessarily Um It was just pushing the envelope of design Um but not always rooted in a solid solution a societal solution,0.98,1.0
210,en-US,4256.7299072,20.8797696,Yeah I mean Uh being an architect is not just about you know working with the software and Uh creating nice things about what you can do with the software But Uh you know seeing it as another tool and Um how to really address important topics that you know the being the creative mind in architecture school Um you know peace be that this,0.95,1.0
211,en-US,4277.6096768,17.4903296,is really the most beautiful state you are in Uh And that also creates this whole passion for architecture and you know do nothing that somehow minimizes this passion Um But maybe this is also the reason that this decrease is very fast Uh and you're thrown into reality,0.95,1.0
212,en-US,4295.770112,32.4599808,Um Yeah So maybe there are some ways how to Uh how to rethink that differently Yeah OK Chris Coming to the close Uh we have one segment that we were introducing this year that we call what was that light And in this segment we we ask our Uh guests Uh what was that like when you did something just to get a little,0.98,1.0
213,en-US,4328.2300927999995,21.680128,bit more information about you and learn a little bit more about you So today I'm going to ask what was it like when you got your first project Hmm Uh Hmm That was quite interesting actually Um And I think getting the first project this Uh is always very very hard,0.98,1.0
214,en-US,4350.1002751999995,12.9294336,You know like Uh before you do a lot of things and just you know it never takes to the next step And you always ask yourself well when will I get when will I take this next step But this feeling never stops right,0.96,1.0
215,en-US,4363.2201728,13.6699904,Yeah this is constant in an architectural description Right Like when do I get the first projects and how do I get the bigger projects How do I get invited to this competition You know how can I get the lecture at this university,0.96,1.0
216,en-US,4377.0097663999995,17.340415999999998,And things like this never somehow stops But this is always a beautiful way of you know growing as an architect But I think especially the first project is a very important one Um And we Uh we actually got it by a very sophisticated Uh business solution,0.96,1.0
217,en-US,4394.3501823999995,22.4997376,So we light Um So this is a very a very good strategy So we lied We lied about the the science is out of our office And you know if I experience and so it's kind of Uh fake it till you make it kind of thing that we had this implicit Uh project,0.86,0.99
218,en-US,4416.84992,18.9898752,This was in China and we we were in the final of the competition and Uh we had to present our projects Um We were both in Austria my wife and myself and we had to present Uh our projects Um but we had just to film our screens because we needed to present the project on our screen,0.96,1.0
219,en-US,4437.160345599999,18.419712,Um So we shared our screen and they couldn't see us Um And we put them in the background at Google YouTube and YouTube Um office background sound So we had to the sound of people chatting and Uh walking around and the effects of seeing this going and telephones were ringing,0.89,1.0
220,en-US,4455.5800576,19.0496768,And so that was it made us it made us Uh sound really sophisticated But actually it was just my wife and and myself and our guitar was at 4:00 presenting this this thing Um And Uh yeah we got we won the projector and we built the project,0.92,1.0
221,en-US,4474.6297343999995,17.700454399999998,And Uh that actually let us start the whole path So we we hired then people who sat in our office and we bought a fax machine and we had some telephones to ring So maybe they didn't really we were just Uh chronologically Uh Uh a bit wrong,0.88,1.0
222,en-US,4492.5001728,12.4899328,Yeah And that's what you just ruined it for a lot of future people that are going to try and pull out Our clients are going to like Let me see Uh Let me see your office Would you give me a tour,0.97,1.0
223,en-US,4507.3301504,19.739852799999998,Yeah No But Uh I think it is Uh it somehow taught us a lesson that it's not necessarily about you know trying to to find yourself and Uh trying to really what you are standing for but also creating yourself Right I think that growing up is a very active Uh thing to do,0.95,1.0
224,en-US,4527.7298688,15.79008,Um And it's really about creating Um a persona that Uh in the beginning when you don't have anything to show because it's a bit of a catch 22 if it's like a client is looking for architects with experience But how should you get the experience if you never had a project before,0.97,1.0
225,en-US,4543.5498496,16.22016,So Um it's a bit of a difficult difficult Uh Uh thing to achieve So yeah Lying for us Definitely Yeah And that's a lesson for Uh you know potential clients as well is you know sometimes take a chance and it'll pay off,0.98,1.0
226,en-US,4560.130048,27.860172799999997,Exactly Thank you very much Chris Uh Thoroughly enjoyed this conversation Hope you enjoyed the conversation as well I did Dimittis thank you for having me I know the huge thank you to Chris You can find out more information about his and his wife's studio at p r e c h t dot 80 and definitely follow them on Instagram,0.97,1.0

230,en-US,4638.4799744,16.8902656,I mean the half life of information is so brief that anything you learn in school I just have no hope that you're actually going to use that in my in my firm And even though we use architect all day long every day that I don't even know that shows up on our job description like I just know,0.96,1.0
