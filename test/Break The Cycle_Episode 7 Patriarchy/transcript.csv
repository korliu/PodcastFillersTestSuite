5,en-US,123.6700032,20.52,Uh We work on different aspects of Uh Uh gender issues Uh But primarily looking at Uh how it affects women and girls Mm hmm Uh There's a lot of work which we do on ground but we use a lot of media tools including digital media to Uh you know spread Uh our messages and awareness,0.98,1.0
6,en-US,144.31000319999998,26.1899904,Mm hmm Um It's a very very large topic But the idea is to break it down into Uh digestible Uh pieces of information And that's where I come in So Uh because I'm sort of a digital junky Uh I have two Twitter accounts to install accounts and I'm not going to bore you with would you have the Twitter account and do Instagram,0.97,1.0

8,en-US,188.2499968,29.2100224,How I feel that no matter where I like matter which position I may be in I think the safest place for me to kind of Start this topic is that I know next to nothing and I can't begin to fathom the issues that Uh women and girls face Um and I'm pretty sure that Uh a lot of us men specifically,0.99,1.0
9,en-US,219.26000639999998,19.5099904,Uh and I don't speak for all men but most men please do not really understand the nuances of the Uh of the issues at hand So I was hoping that you could Uh treat this like a classroom and teach me So that I'm a little more aware and a little more sensitive because there are a lot of there are a,0.98,1.0
10,en-US,238.7699968,17.460019199999998,lot of things I think we end up doing unconsciously because of Well I mean I could call it conditioning but I would probably be Blaming my unconscious behavior on that so Um Like I said it's a very very Uh vast topic,0.98,1.0
11,en-US,256.2899968,23.7999872,And Um I think I'm want to start with Um Our stories as people Um something as simple as how we experience life Right Um So if I look at you So you were born a meal Mm hmm Uh You grew up with the notions that you're a boy,0.94,1.0
12,en-US,280.47999999999996,22.5099776,Right Why is that I guess I was told to All right Do you still think you're a boy slash man No I would guess giving conventional wisdom Why why do you think that you're the man in the most conventional sense or understanding,0.92,1.0
13,en-US,303.2300032,17.2,Um I would shoot it for me to put it like very crassly I would probably put it to biological urges I mean does that make sense It can Um If you can define the orgies I am more attracted to women than I am to men and I think that's the conventional barometer,0.94,1.0
14,en-US,320.630016,18.8999936,Yeah I guess Uh But Uh aside let's leave that aside because you could also be a woman and still be attractive Of course Of course Yeah Uh So that doesn't really make you a man not just to somebody who's attracted to women Uh but what makes you a man,0.96,1.0
15,en-US,340.8,18.110003199999998,Honestly I have no idea Is it the way that you built You were born with the certain genitalia Is that enough Uh reason for you to be calling yourself a man I would say that I mean given given the,0.98,1.0
16,en-US,360.4,17.670016,Is a so-called red and instead of basically been passed down to me from my parents and everyone else and societal conditions I would kind of give me along with that Uh about should I mean And yes physical attributes are built a certain way,0.92,1.0
17,en-US,378.15999999999997,17.4599936,Yes The genitalia that Uh comes in as well Um But if I were to sit down and say OK I identify as a man because of this and that's my opinion I am not very sure Hmm So I mean like a non conditioned response is something I'm not very aware of,0.98,1.0
18,en-US,396.15999999999997,16.440012799999998,That's fine Uh I think it's a very simple question Uh here for you to answer Mm hmm That you experience life because as a man Mm hmm Uh But what does that Uh mean to you What does being a man mean to you,0.97,1.0
19,en-US,414.0,20.0100096,Like right now today what does that mean to forget that we're in a very politically chaotic situation Uh No I'm not going to go with the I'm not going to go with the politically correct word Uh But I think for me specifically it's probably,0.98,1.0
20,en-US,435.26000639999995,15.84,Just living up to the ideals that I've kind of set to my set for myself Um While I'm not going to throw in vague terms like being a protector because I mean my mother is my protector so that technically doesn't fit into the whole male thing,0.97,1.0
21,en-US,452.4400128,16.239974399999998,Um Um but yeah I guess I mean All right OK so Um what are you trying to deflect You know it is Um That's not even aware if I'm deflecting anything but Yeah OK I do not want to be just day to day feel,0.87,1.0
22,en-US,468.6900224,17.3299712,But Um my question Uh did is when I asked you this question is Um how do you perceive life Uh And you gave me very very simple Um answers which were Um not really linked to your agenda Right Yeah That is you as a person,0.97,1.0
23,en-US,486.0499968,18.5399808,Right You know you you like women You have certain ideas about yourself and how you want to be Absolutely Um Now Uh let's actually break it down to what I feel so right Uh since we're talking about us Uh Oh I was born a girl,0.96,1.0
24,en-US,504.67998719999997,16.48,Mm hmm Um I'm supposed to be a girl a woman when I grow up because of all the biological reasons that Uh they're right Um As a teenager of course I was very confused with menstruation Why does it happen to me,0.92,1.0
25,en-US,521.1800064,14.5499648,I do not want this feminity right Uh associated with me but I was very very confused Mm hmm And as I grew older I realized that I have to be a certain way Like you had to be a certain way,0.97,1.0
26,en-US,535.7600256,25.469952,Yeah because I'm a girl So it's as simple as that What is the whole idea behind being a certain way Hmm Is where we get into gender roles and expectations OK Uh so I'm a girl Hmm I'm not supposed to Uh you know be somebody who asks out a guy because that's not OK,0.97,1.0
27,en-US,561.3799935999999,18.3000064,Girls don't do that Then all of the things that girls do not do Right Uh Which also mean goes the way I'm sitting right now I'm not supposed to sit with my legs spread wide open because that's not OK if it goes to do,0.93,1.0
28,en-US,579.849984,16.96,Yeah Uh and I'm sure you also might have heard of a lot of rules for yourself Uh Uh being a guy And and those rules actually do not come you know in a PowerPoint presentation Do that just fed into you as you grew up with your peers,0.95,1.0
29,en-US,597.9799552,18.3300608,Uh So Um what am I actually Uh asking everybody to do is just just look at Uh how Um Like I said how you experience life how certain ideas are shaped in your head Uh Like I gave you my example of how a goal should be,0.98,1.0
30,en-US,616.310016,18.9899776,I need to have long hair otherwise I'm not a girl enough Hmm Um I need to be Uh always covered and always be Um you know careful when I'm around men Mm hmm Uh Again this is all conditioning These are all unwritten rules of being a girl and a guy I think,0.97,1.0
31,en-US,637.12,15.3299968,Uh When we talk about these issues it's the most important thing is you have to keep yourself in the center right because Uh Uh it's not just about what I work on It's also about what I believe in Is that personal is political,0.99,1.0
32,en-US,652.5700095999999,23.0700032,Right Yeah And in the time you're not able to be so self into any conversation Yeah I'm not saying be self obsessed and be narcissistic but Yeah Yeah So Um of course I drop it as we go along So what I'm talking about is there are certain gendered expectations and rules we're all supposed to play,0.92,1.0
33,en-US,675.9699456,19.6801024,Right Yeah Like you mentioned the whole idea of a man being a protector while you may not agree with it Uh It is a message that is given to boys Take care of your sister Yes Helpful Uh Well you know when she's in a public space you know go and drop her won't be cut up and sure that she's,0.97,1.0
34,en-US,695.650048,11.9299584,safe or the age old or the man of the house Yeah You're the man of the house And what does that really mean Um Can a woman not be the head of a house Um or is something missing that Mm hmm,0.95,1.0
35,en-US,709.3300224,13.3499904,Um So I think that there are a lot of questions and a lot of things that one can explored Mm hmm But yeah here's my confusion though Yeah Um And forgive my ignorance because I could be completely off Uh with this,0.96,1.0
36,en-US,723.8900224,22.829926399999998,We have seen some societies uh maybe not maybe not up north of the country where the women where the women are actually leading the house or considered the leaders of the house So where's that gap really like when it comes to and I'm probably going off topic completely here because I mean obviously we're trying to we're looking,0.96,1.0
37,en-US,746.7199488,18.960025599999998,at the inequalities that are there based on gender And it's not just I believe it's not just about the two conventional genders that exist That is a whole conversation about a whole host of them now Um But just from that perspective where does this concept of,0.97,1.0
38,en-US,766.8300287999999,20.5100032,This one leads or this one leads coming from or how we kind of I mean is there a place where we bridge that gap at all Um I would not want to praise them but I think the European societies Uh or some parts of the European society is slightly closer to that equality,0.98,1.0
39,en-US,788.1799679999999,26.0400128,Uh However looking at the larger context of our world Uh and our country as well Um What you asked about Uh who leads what is actually linked to the idea of who controls the resources And that's the most basic human need to have resources to have food to have shelter Um and thanks to capitalism to have money and and everything else then,0.99,1.0
40,en-US,814.2199807999999,18.850047999999997,gets converted into the need for power and to control people's lives Right That's where the whole thing kind of leans in Hmm Well Uh there is a conversation around who leads and who's more powerful and Um I think Uh the whole,0.96,1.0
41,en-US,835.7499904,23.4699776,Uh Let me rephrase this It's about the fight for Uh who controls maximum resources Mm hmm Right Mm hmm So you're talking about resources right Yeah Um I get the part where you're talking about power but when you're talking about a it's OK I don't even know if this is a word familial,0.97,1.0
42,en-US,859.219968,19.0400512,Is there a word OK so it is familial context Yeah Talking about families I mean we have this entire thing of our families are together and how your one unit where does a concept of power coming back Exactly,0.96,1.0
43,en-US,879.190016,19.40992,Um I think the Uh something that we have to think Uh through when we talk about families and structures and dynamics Um is the whole idea that what does a family mean A family constitutes Uh typically a man who's married to a woman,0.96,1.0
44,en-US,898.6900479999999,16.219955199999998,Mm hmm And they produce children Right Uh I mean if we're looking at a very very unconventional concept OK I think that's how the concept of family also originated Of course there is a lot of debate on how the family structure should be and should it be fluid enough,0.94,1.0
45,en-US,914.919936,17.8200576,But I do agree that it should be that people should be able to choose what and who they call family But that's another conversation All right Here I'm talking about a very typical structure of a man who goes and again this is this is a structure that we're all born into,0.98,1.0
46,en-US,932.8600064,14.670028799999999,Mm hmm Uh Most of us are born into and Um we sort of follow it through as we go Uh forward in life Mm hmm There is a man who's the father He is also the provider of the family Simple enough that he's the one who brings in money,0.94,1.0
47,en-US,947.5300351999999,29.819903999999998,Food takes care of the family Uh That is the mother She's the mother is always a woman Mm hmm You know typically Uh And she's supposed to bear children and give birth right Yeah Um The only issue is that when the child is born whose name or who has mo'ed Um rights or that child it's the man that it's the father,0.94,1.0
48,en-US,978.0800512,17.9299328,You are given your father's name You'd given you under your father's protection And that includes a mother as well Like I said typically Yeah Um So the whole idea that a woman is Um the woman is going to produce children for another family,0.97,1.0
49,en-US,996.0699903999999,18.869964799999998,Mm hmm So the whole idea and here is verse and reference actually comes in Mm hmm That you want to have a son read the resources of that particular family are given to the son because the daughter needs she gets married off and she leaves and becomes a part of another family,0.96,1.0
50,en-US,1015.3900031999999,21.420032,Wow OK Yeah Yeah Um So when you talk about who fights for that power Uh it's the person who's the owner And I'm seeing it in the boys class with Uh the father is looked as Hmm Uh But not necessarily treated as the owner of that family,0.96,1.0
51,en-US,1036.8100352,19.6499456,And hence he's the head of the family He's the main decision maker And the woman of course who's supposed to be his equal Uh ends up doing the softer work which just domestic chores Uh taking care of the children taking care of everybody's needs Um becomes the second duty decision maker,0.95,1.0
52,en-US,1056.7099392,16.4600832,OK so Um if you go through like I said if you go and look at this whole dynamic you will you will start seeing very different stat You know emoji All right So Um what I mean to say is everything is about money,0.95,1.0
53,en-US,1073.5300608,24.8999936,Oh boy Yeah Beauty akis greatest ally is Uh power and control over resources Mm hmm And that justifies everything that justifies inequality It justifies how a woman should be treated in a family It justifies the whole idea that one has to have sons in the family to keep the resources within the family,0.95,1.0
54,en-US,1099.030016,16.609996799999998,So like I said every social inequalities route is money and resources Wow That's a mic drop for me I'm just trying to process this Thank you OK so wait Are you saying OK you're not really seeing that but,0.95,1.0
55,en-US,1115.7700608,25.959936,All right I get the point that it all it ends up becoming about resources In a lot of in a lot of ways but then when we're talking about at least my Uh conversations around patriarchy you know I've had very few Um have largely been about I think the one the ethics which I believe is again my belief no,0.94,1.0
56,en-US,1141.7299968,25.339903999999997,idea about and no idea not in authority not Uh about the ethics that come in Uh The conduct towards Uh men women every other gender And Uh the let's face it the ignorance of men Specifically and I am going to call that out with fucking ignorant,0.92,1.0
57,en-US,1169.7900544,17.909862399999998,Here is where I'm going to get a little more the and drug and heavy and thanks to social media a lot of people now have Um understood the word privilege right Yeah Um OK what does privilege mean according to you if you were to define it,0.94,1.0
58,en-US,1187.7900287999998,19.1399936,I mean I would say that a lot of things are given to me fairly easily because of a number of factors my gender being one of them Other than your gender financial status I believe the family was born into GOST for sure although I'm not really aware of that,0.98,1.0
59,en-US,1207.1000064,20.869939199999997,I mean I haven't gotten that deep into it but I'm pretty sure that kind of factors in um the color of my skin There you go Um The reason of course the cost angle is also some something that that actually speaks volumes about how with all of a privileged Gough's enhanced,0.88,1.0
60,en-US,1227.9699455999998,23.2900608,We do not know because Uh the discrimination on the basis of us doesn't affect us Exactly Similarly Uh discrimination Uh on the basis of gender does not affect men the same way Right Or it does not I'd say it does not put men at a disadvantage the way it does for women and other genders,0.97,1.0
61,en-US,1252.0400895999999,25.1099136,True Wouldn't you say that men are the instigators of that Uh discrimination I'd say that it's a system right Patriarchy the system OK so is capitalism by the way Um And together is it's a deadly combination Mm hmm Um So I think if I could draw I would draw what patriarchy does for people,0.97,1.0
62,en-US,1277.1500032,20.5200384,And I'm going to talk strictly by Indonesian men and women OK The system of patriarchy What does it want from men It wants men to be powerful It wants men to be the breadwinners of the family They want men to be aggressive masculine,0.99,1.0
63,en-US,1297.8599936,19.9000064,Hmm Um You know again like I said somebody Uh who's pretty strong according to what the system has set for them Mm hmm Uh But what is it want from women Patriarchy typically wants women women to be subservient Mm hmm They want the system,0.96,1.0
64,en-US,1317.7700352,18.829926399999998,Want women to To be submissive Mm hmm And that is why it's been kept alive for this long because it was easier to control women and it's easier to elevate men And that's how the system has been working,0.96,1.0
65,en-US,1337.0500095999998,28.1499648,However the system stops working and men and women start thinking for themselves Right So I do not blame just men Mm hmm But I also see that the system gives them a lot of advantage Like we discussed privilege the the reason why men can't see Uh how their behaviors Uh affect women say at a workplace Uh is because men have,0.96,1.0
66,en-US,1365.1999744,15.2100864,a male privilege Um and your privilege actually stops you from understanding what somebody else is going to do All right Yeah And it puts you at the Adobe pedestal at a much higher ground where you just cannot see below what's happening,0.96,1.0
67,en-US,1381.7299968,15.810048,Um It's also because power elevates And when you take away that power from women and that's what patriarchy does it puts women down So like I said it's that it was a level which is patriarchy It elevates men and it dismisses women,0.98,1.0
68,en-US,1398.230016,15.8399488,That is how beautifully functions However men also face issues because of it Jackie and so do women But they face it in very different ways Yeah Yeah Men face it because there's an extreme amount of pressure on them to perform,0.96,1.0
69,en-US,1414.3699967999999,14.9100544,Mm hmm And masculinity is about performance Yeah You know to perform you know you have to take risks to perform You have to be better than everybody else to perform You have to take everything that you feel entitled to,0.99,1.0
70,en-US,1429.3499904,18.5899008,Mm hmm Uh That means they're very egoistic view Yeah Me me me me Yes And that's bad Uh It's I mean it's not for sure that every man is able to perform at that level as is expected of him And he starts failing,0.96,1.0
71,en-US,1448.3599359999998,17.3101056,And the whole idea that you're not a man enough Mm hmm Is that the problem starts happening And hence a chamber of insecurity has been created within the idea of masculinity that you have to be a man enough,0.95,1.0
72,en-US,1466.0600832,16.0198656,And if you're not man enough you will be bullied You will be called out Uh you will be mocked And yeah your life basically sucks and you should die And hence Uh the suicide rates among men are at an all time high at this point,0.97,1.0
73,en-US,1482.5999359999998,16.609996799999998,Oh man Yeah of course Um I could talk on and on about what it does to women Um But if there are specific questions because I have a long list and it's also coming from a very personal space of rage,0.99,1.0
74,en-US,1500.140032,24.150015999999997,Uh But let me not get into that right now No actually I do want to get into that I actually wondered which is something I do Uh is ask people to kind of share personal experiences because while the message is important Um Um Um I think that people relate more when it's coming from someone who's faced it and has gotten out of,0.98,1.0
75,en-US,1524.2900479999998,16.859955199999998,it Absolutely And that's why I said one has to place yourself in Um in any doping that you're talking about Mm hmm Uh I do that too Uh And it's very personal for me Hmm Um So I call myself a feminist Mm hmm,0.95,1.0
76,en-US,1541.3000192,16.5000192,And I've called myself a feminist since the age of 18 Mm hmm Um Simply because I could not understand why I have to be treated differently Mm hmm I could not understand that Why my mother was mocked for not being sons,0.95,1.0
77,en-US,1558.249984,20.699955199999998,And she has two daughters Right I could not understand Why is that a bad thing Mm hmm I could not understand that Why am I supposed to be under somebodies protection And when I see somebody see that and it is who it could be my father my mother or some other man or a boy Uh like a younger,0.98,1.0
78,en-US,1578.9499392,18.6001408,cousin who's four years younger than me and yet he's equipped enough to take care of me and I'm not And that made me feel small Mm hmm I could not understand that Why If I liked a boy I could not go up to him Uh and ask him out,0.99,1.0

84,en-US,1674.5200639999998,17.5799296,And I found that answer at the age of 18 when I started reading feminist literature and and understanding what feminism actually means Mm hmm Uh Oh it just means that women do not have to speak shit right from this society,0.95,1.0
85,en-US,1692.199936,15.3500672,Mm hmm Just because they're women it's as simple as that That women deserve to be treated equally with respect Uh Just the way I wanted to be treated as a human being Um and not be molested or stalked every other day,0.96,1.0

88,en-US,1743.8799872,14.3699968,So yeah I mean we all like all women you know have been through this and they know that you know you take certain measures to keep yourself safe eventually And there is a certain fear that you live with and grew up with,0.97,1.0
89,en-US,1758.4300031999999,21.329919999999998,Mm hmm Um So I know And this gets very dark Uh when we talk about assault Mm hmm Uh And that's the thing about sexual assault that Um is not of a particular kind as we've all known Uh the many nuances to sexual assault as well,0.97,1.0
90,en-US,1780.8101376,15.869952,Uh But what it leaves you with is Uh And like I said molestation is sexual assault as well It kind of leaves you with the whole With this you know with this question like why me what did I do wrong what did I do to deserve this,0.99,1.0
91,en-US,1797.159936,18.060083199999998,And then I realized actually I do deserve respect as simple as that And I think that's that's all I want to see While feminism itself is a is again a very broad Um you know topic to sort of unfold but I think it's it's just about that,0.96,1.0
92,en-US,1815.2200192,27.459993599999997,Why can't I be treated as an equal Mm hmm Uh Is I think most women feel Well I am going to move to my next question Um Yeah I think what I want to do Uh what I do want to ask is that the conversations thankfully thankfully have been on the rise Uh with respect to the inequalities that women face,0.96,1.0
93,en-US,1842.7099136,17.780121599999998,And yes there are a lot of topics a lot of discussions that aren't patriarchy as well Um What is the work that's currently being done in order to break this pattern that a lot of people have with respect to patriarchy,0.96,1.0
94,en-US,1861.4499328,14.640127999999999,Because I know on one end that there are a lot of organizations that are working with women to kind of at least educate them and tell them that they do have the power to break out of this Um Is there something being done with men as well,1.0,1.0
95,en-US,1877.1099648,19.1100928,Yeah I think Uh that that's a question we should all be asking and not just from the civil society organizations Um Uh I actually push back on this Um because I work in a feminist organization We work on issues of violence against women particularly,0.97,1.0
96,en-US,1896.3099648,20.8799744,Right Uh And I you know when flash discrimination is violence Right Are you okay with that Of course Of course Yeah Uh But general knowledge doesn't really Uh agree with that that discrimination and violence are two different things However there are not many times discrimination is a gateway to violence,0.96,1.0
97,en-US,1917.6400896,23.909990399999998,Many times discrimination itself is violence Um and the consequences of it Right Um The kind of work that is being done right now Uh is to Um is to look at how young people understand gender how they understand equality inequality how they understand what is expected of them,0.99,1.0
98,en-US,1941.8200064,19.079987199999998,What do they want to be in life Mm hmm And that's where you start You start early You start working with Uh adolescents actually from the age of 11 Mm hmm That's where children start Uh Uh You know that's where your conditioning begins,0.98,1.0
99,en-US,1960.9599999999998,28.7698944,The real conditioning begins And it's been scientifically proven that puberty is where you Uh are You create certain notions about Uh you know people life the world Uh which actually remain unchanged Uh throughout And it's tough to change them later on Therefore you start working with Um sensitizing children at a younger age Um see from the class when they enter Uh middle school,0.98,1.0
100,en-US,1990.1700096,20.5000704,OK And that's where we also start working Uh at Breakthrough And we work with boys and girls water Uh simply for one reason Uh And we have to Uh do approaches with both of them Uh But the common understanding is that we all treat each other with respect,0.96,1.0
101,en-US,2011.0600192,16.859955199999998,And there's an audio difference between how people are Um and equal doesn't mean sin Hmm Right So Uh you and I could be equal but we don't have to be seen And that's the whole idea about this gender sensitization that is happening at a school level,0.94,1.0
102,en-US,2028.2200063999999,27.8401024,Okay Um And working with boys is a very very important Uh thing because Uh we're also looking at generational change You know change comes in into somebody who's who's actually grown up with the idea that Uh I'm a man and Um I'm a gift to this world and who has a big sticker Uh you know Uh on this God which like Casanova and called,0.89,1.0
103,en-US,2056.0601088,22.859776,I'm your boyfriend So that guy's not going to change in a day because of everyday messages he's got from his family and society And because therefore you have to start working with boys at a very early age And for them to start questioning the inequalities in their own lives how the sisters are treated how their mothers are,0.96,1.0
104,en-US,2078.9198848,24.200191999999998,treated how they are treated Uh because they're boys So Uh that's that's an interesting space that Uh most of the work is Happening and I do agree with your point on working with men as well because Uh while I'd say there's been a lot of work done on how to empower women you don't have to empower women,0.97,1.0
105,en-US,2103.2400896,13.8897408,And women have the power You just have to generalize that and ensure there's an environment where women can flourish Uh The same hasn't been done for men to give up that power Right Why would a man want to give up that power,0.94,1.0
106,en-US,2117.2400128,17.2900352,Hmm Because that makes me powerful and strong Why should I give it to somebody else when I can control things Mm hmm However Um what does well is empathy Mm hmm Uh The empathy that is sort of missing in a very masculine culture,0.97,1.0
107,en-US,2135.2800256,14.9399552,Mm hmm Yeah Yeah Yeah Because empathy is seen as a as a weak trait Uh Empathy is seen as something that a woman would have but a man needn't necessarily show Can I be really serious typical in color to soft drink,0.86,0.965
108,en-US,2151.2699904,16.4399104,Of course Yeah So I mean that's that's one of the things that you probably end up hearing Yeah That he's a soft guy Oh God Yeah Uh And he's a sissy and all that nonsense that we all hear Yeah,0.95,1.0
109,en-US,2168.6398976,20.310015999999997,Um Uh But it's it's also missing from how you conditioned as well that you're not supposed to feel certain emotions as a man Uh You're not supposed to also value them Um So therefore I think it's going to be a tough task for somebody to give up that power,0.98,1.0
110,en-US,2188.969984,17.0100736,And I'm not talking about giving up the roads Yeah because that's what men's rights activists actually fight for And that's the whole point All rights have been given to men The idea is not to take away any rights but to take away the power that actually puts them at a higher plane than other agendas,0.95,1.0
111,en-US,2207.0900736,15.960064,Uh And it's it's a very tough journey Uh but we've seen that of even working with different men's groups And you have to start small You have to work with individuals I do a lot of work on masculinity and working with men and boys,0.99,1.0
112,en-US,2223.0501375999997,21.029888,And I feel that now the focus should be on transformation of Uh how men view the world and what they want in life and how they just live Also I mean the gendered expectations from men also Right Uh But what is it that will make them feel that we're all in it together,0.97,1.0
113,en-US,2244.4099584,20.610048,Yeah I mean that's it And just treat each other with respect with genuine respect And Um and to understand that vulnerabilities are not always bad Hmm Uh For the men and for the woman also that if a woman is vulnerable let me go and take advantage of that,0.97,1.0
114,en-US,2265.2299264,14.9399552,I mean that has to stop Definitely But also to stop the whole idea that if I feel vulnerable I'm less of a man Mm hmm And of course the whole thing that if you're more feminine it's bad If you're more masculine it's good,0.97,1.0
115,en-US,2280.2900992,15.3300992,Mm hmm So that Binelli also needs to break and that will break as we have more conversations Um that are mass media messages that go out Um I think I do want to point out that in the Indian context why this began,0.97,1.0
116,en-US,2296.699904,17.1001856,Uh There's a lot of conversation on how women are treated and you know gender inequalities all of that while we've all known it at a certain level Mm hmm Though the highlight I'd say or the milestone that comes to my mind is Uh the need,0.96,1.0
117,en-US,2313.8201599999998,24.7599104,We are noticing here a case that happened in Delhi Mm hmm That actually woke up to this nation this entire nation that there is violence happening Uh towards women and it can't be taken lightly anymore While there have been the calls and the lack of rapes and murders before that Uh this was that turning point where television where media,0.93,1.0
118,en-US,2338.5800704,20.9399808,Covid Uh the justice system the you know the armed and the actually you know took notice and realized that there's something wrong while nobody could understand how to start that change But there was a lot of conversation and there were mass movements a lot of protests,0.97,1.0
119,en-US,2359.8501888,16.3497984,And I mean the whole world knows about it now And I think there was a big push towards this idea that Uh women are Uh treated badly More than that women are killed for being a woman Uh Rapes happen so regularly,0.97,1.0
120,en-US,2376.6499328,20.9000448,And Um I think what what really breaks my heart is that it took an act of violence for us to realize that I think we also I mean this is just my perception of it because probably And I'm Uh I'm guilty of being party to this Um when a lot of these discussions were happening,1.0,1.0
121,en-US,2397.8799104,15.3100288,I think a lot of us just the cynics and I was I say was because Sure I think I have hope in humanity But Uh I think the cynic in me said nothing's going to change Nothing's ever going to change,0.98,1.0
122,en-US,2413.2100096,19.1100928,All you can do is be safe and you know treat the symptom which is on the women You know everyone's just like on the buzzin use a weapon something like that everyone started with self-defense classes like this I mean that that was part of what I was doing for a while,0.94,1.0
123,en-US,2433.5300608,13.139763199999999,But then I don't really think that is systemic I mean to my mind Uh that was and I think I had a realization then that that's just treating a symptom But this is going to be something that's very long Bill,0.97,1.0
124,en-US,2448.0600064,16.020070399999998,But do you think we kind of lost the narrative of we need to focus on the cause rather than just treat the effect Or are we doing that or like are we doing that now Are we treating the cause or are we doing the effect,0.98,1.0
125,en-US,2465.6699392,14.430207999999999,I think we are doing both Mm hmm And what is harder of course you and I both Uh are in agreement that it's tougher to treat the cause the root cause of it Because that's where the most backlash begins,0.96,1.0
126,en-US,2481.6297984,16.6602752,The whole Um conversation has been about violence against women Mm hmm But like in in the most heretical ways that I Uh you know I work Uh in my workplace We break it down Why does that happen Why is it so normalized and why is it so ugly,0.97,1.0
127,en-US,2499.6001791999997,23.609753599999998,Uh Why are certain laws about Um around you know safety of women Sexual harassment laws assault domestic violence vile disorders and Yeah Yeah They never existed in this country but it's only after a lot of push from different activists and different Um stakeholders actually that these laws got formed,0.96,1.0
128,en-US,2524.4098559999998,24.9602048,And that's pretty recent And it takes that Um I mean we got to see India got independence in 47 The D.V. law Uh came into Uh existence around 2002 2003 Um including Um issues like Um Uh child sexual abuse which comes on the Boxhall also very recent in the in the last two decades,0.93,1.0
129,en-US,2549.4599679999997,23.4899456,Mm hmm Um So now imagine where we stand Everything is very new understanding that violence against children women girls young boys people who are vulnerable Uh We've started understanding that and we started working on policies that would you know take care of that but also started working on messaging rather recently,0.99,1.0
130,en-US,2573.3998592,19.380224,So Uh I think it's going to take generations to actually make that dent Mm hmm But my point about violence is that again these are always I mean these are all Um I mean the laws exist so that you know you can access it when something bad happens to you,0.98,1.0
131,en-US,2593.0201088,14.0699648,But the preventive part is still missing Hmm And the preventive part can only be worked on if you work with Um if you actually break down why it happens Like you said work with the cause Well work with why,0.96,1.0
132,en-US,2608.0301056,20.519935999999998,Uh Why it's happening why it's happening And the simple reason is that women are not valuable or important enough One can discard them Right One has complete access or entitlement over the bodies Marital rape still exists And we still not ready to have that conversation in this country,0.99,1.0
133,en-US,2628.570112,16.709836799999998,I was the one to get into that But so Um I think violence happens at the last level Before that there is a you know there's a lot of things that we not Um really really addressing I mean it's just begun,0.94,1.0
134,en-US,2645.6999935999997,19.079987199999998,And a lot of feminists actually get flack for talking about them talking about why patriarchy exists and how it women are at a disadvantage We may like it or not Mm hmm Uh I mean it's an inconvenient truth And we're not ready to have that conversation as a society,0.97,1.0
135,en-US,2665.9500032,16.3500032,Uh The value of a woman that that she's a burden on her family She's a burden on the society Her safety becomes a challenge Hood Uh you know biological needs become a challenge There's a reason why people do not want to hire women at workplaces,0.98,1.0
136,en-US,2682.4200192,16.3899392,Mm hmm Uh There's a reason why Uh because of safety concerns People are still you know sort of stuck that if if should I hired a woman do I need to provide gap to her Uh What if something happens to her then,0.96,1.0
137,en-US,2698.8300288,12.8698368,You know I have to like my organization has to take the fall Hmm And that actually prevents the men from actually Uh entering the workplace is why should I invest in my girl child when I have to get married off eventually,0.95,1.0
138,en-US,2713.4900224,15.9698944,Uh So I mean there is just a lot of discrimination like I said and it eventually leads to violence the physical violence that we see So like I said if there was a shock I could draw I know I would,0.94,1.0
139,en-US,2730.6000384,14.159872,Uh But like both of us agree on that We have to look at the different causes Uh The most critical lens and keep on asking the question why why why why But the time we are not ready to do that,0.91,1.0
140,en-US,2744.9999359999997,19.9200768,We're not going to move an inch I guess you answered a bit of my second last question but Uh I'm going to go ahead and ask you Um Typically I would ask you know what do you think that people could do like just actionable steps and how they could kind of break out of this particular set,0.97,1.0
141,en-US,2765.1201023999997,15.77984,But here I'm just going to ask you for step one because I don't think people have even begun that step yet Yeah So what is the one thing we could do to at least start Uh kind of breaking out of this pattern,0.98,1.0
142,en-US,2781.8600447999997,25.500057599999998,I don't think I can answer that with one step really Uh But you know just considering that women are human beings on their own Mm hmm They are pretty much equal to anybody else Any man that that's around Hudd I mean if there is that understanding that she's a human being with her own complexities and her own issues,0.98,1.0
143,en-US,2807.3601024,19.2,and her Um own biases also Uh with her own challenges Uh I think that is good enough And you have to look at women beyond just a body not an object or a body Uh I think that is step one Really like I'm going to do any baekdu,0.97,1.0
144,en-US,2827.93984,24.3601408,They teaching the alphabet Uh But if you just start looking at women as people Mm hmm That is that And also trusting them with the taking decisions Uh for themselves and for others as well because it's very easy to Um overburden and say that you know this is how you stay safe,0.91,1.0
145,en-US,2852.68992,12.4801024,But when will be asked this society this question that why aren't women safe When does it end Yeah When does it end Why does it have to happen in the first place if she's out of her house or what,0.96,1.0
146,en-US,2865.4999552,21.149900799999998,Even if she's in the house she's not yours to Yeah Yeah Access Um So I think the it's the dehumanization of women that has actually landed obscured Mm hmm Uh And I'm just glad that a lot of women of our generation and even older generation Uh have been speaking about it,0.97,1.0
147,en-US,2887.0100992,19.079987199999998,Mm hmm Uh And and I think that is another very important aspect here that we all forget and we do not Um talk about is sexuality Mm hmm Um The patriarchal society is afraid off of homosexuality especially when she owns it,0.97,1.0
148,en-US,2906.1799935999998,24.8100864,Mm hmm It is okay to abuse it through a man Mm hmm The man kind of owns it Right Where the man is entitled to it But when it comes to say expression of sexuality from a woman herself or the lack of expression of sexuality that also is a choice Uh you know that actually disturbs the patriarchal dynamic,0.99,1.0
149,en-US,2931.6798464,21.900288,And our society is afraid of that woman Mm hmm We need to understand again women are complex beings just like men are complex beings Women have their own needs Women have their own ideas Uh And if only there was a space to express without being judged without facing violence as well Uh and making choices,0.99,1.0
150,en-US,2954.8701696,18.809856,Um Because I think I mean you need another podcast Uh on just understanding what Milieus Uh has created a monster that Uh I'm probably going to have to do that Yeah This is a vast vast vast subject Yeah Just think of women as people,0.99,1.0
