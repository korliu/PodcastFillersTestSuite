24,en-US,349.80999679999996,14.6100224,So I really I don't know Maybe it's because I've been married a while that like I try to be real careful and not make I don't know age jokes but as a tour guide and where I'm sometimes doing history and I'm speaking to crowds especially when I do stuff where I was promoting the Detroit beer book Uh I,0.99,1.0
25,en-US,364.42001919999996,14.9099776,would have these mixed age groups a lot of times Sometimes I have much older groups and it's like I'd be like from your generation And then people look at me and smile you know and but you always try to like dance around that and not say like you know for all the old people in the crowd,0.99,1.0
26,en-US,379.44,15.969996799999999,Right I'm asking you this question because I'm assuming you were around when that happened You know and you try to when I was your age the snow was up to my chin that kind of stuff Right Yeah Now that we're somewhere you know in the in the upper part of the middle I guess I don't know what,0.99,1.0

28,en-US,410.41000959999997,12.6000128,You know that's kind of messed up right now I feel like I'm half the time when I'm talking and I'm trying to give older people knowledge that I'm sure when I was younger I would just roll my eyes at people when they would say stuff like that to me,0.99,1.0
29,en-US,423.7300224,13.9199488,So OK that got us off the subject But let's get off the So OK so you and George Uh started brewing beer and then eventually you said let's start a brewery Yep So how did you arrive at your first location in Warren,0.96,1.0
30,en-US,438.8299776,13.9400192,Uh Like talk to me a little bit about that Wow So we we basically had no money You know we're just trying to figure out you know at the time This is seven years ago Um Wow Seven years ago Yeah,0.98,1.0
31,en-US,453.1099648,12.9700352,That we started planning all the Listen you know we were convinced we could just throw up a card table put some tarps up there and sell some beer Right That was just happened That was our attitude Um So it was,0.95,1.0
32,en-US,467.5500032,17.9899904,We were trying to find a building we could go into and What happened was we could never find anything we could afford in any area that we were decently interested in Um So just for the heck of it I threw an ad out on Craigslist and I said,1.0,1.0
33,en-US,487.1199744,19.5300352,Uh Two guys looking to open a brewery looking for a restaurant to partner with needs space you know contact us and Uh Mike the owner of the building that we're currently in Um Had a diner and he e-mailed me within a couple of hours within a couple hours and was like yeah come let's talk,0.98,1.0
34,en-US,507.1000064,16.2899968,Wow OK so we worked out Uh Uh what was the name of the diner originally Uh was called My Mother's Place OK And Uh and for for the old timers no doubt Right It was originally a classic restaurant a clock restaurant Wow,0.95,1.0
35,en-US,523.4200063999999,9.749964799999999,Oh yeah I did not know that OK I knew the mothers I just hadn't thought about it in a while Yeah OK I had never personally heard of clacker seen a clock but I guess they were a pretty big chain in the area,0.97,1.0
36,en-US,533.2000256,12.899942399999999,OK Um I'm trying to picture any of those I mean I grew up in the east side but I can't remember those Yeah I don't know Yeah So we worked out Uh a good deal with Mike And Uh where were you,0.98,1.0
37,en-US,547.2100352,14.9699584,Really good rent rate and basically pay the land contract on it And the rest is history And we scraped up enough money to remodel buy some equipment And we basically us and a few friends built the whole place,0.97,1.0
38,en-US,562.9600256,14.399948799999999,What was the original size of the brew system you had in there Uh Timber That was a temple I always thought that was smaller OK Yeah Old Uh dairy equipment from the 60s that was retrofitted Where'd you find that Uh There's a guy in Wisconsin,0.97,1.0
39,en-US,577.3599743999999,15.619993599999999,That's that's all he does Oh really He runs around buys old dairy equipment retrofits it and sells it off to people starting breweries That seems like a smart business model Yeah So then we just buy a couple of fermenters and Uh went to town,0.97,1.0
40,en-US,592.9900031999999,16.970035199999998,It was the cheapest way to get started OK And it was it the two of you Bruen as you first started Yeah OK When eventually did you bring someone else in on some bruen Um Well the first year Um it was mostly me doing all the brewing and then various friends,0.97,1.0
41,en-US,609.9699711999999,16.0200192,I would just say hey can you help me brew today Okay That sounds super familiar Yeah Yeah And so it was random assistant every day and then Um started doing the classic Uh Hey are you a home brewer and interested in learning craft beer,0.97,1.0
42,en-US,626.0200447999999,17.759999999999998,Well here you go Come and help me brew And then that rolled into Um hiring one of those home brewers Uh Eric Stephenson Right Uh I know Eric is my assistant So that's how that worked OK And that was that was probably a year in year and a half in that that happen,0.97,1.0
43,en-US,643.9899647999999,11.8800384,That's probably about when I brought a group in maybe the first time I was trying to look at my records and I brought Uh groups and a whole bunch of times over the years But I want to say I was about a year in until maybe I did that the first time,0.97,1.0
44,en-US,655.8700031999999,10.739968,A lot of times that's what I try to do as you're trying to get your feet wet and figure it all out It never works the way you think it could or wants to So when did the food part get brought,0.99,1.0
45,en-US,666.6099712,14.7300352,And did you start food right away Yeah you did didn't you We did We Uh the thought was we're in Warna We're up against Countians and Dragon Mead who you know exceptional breweries They had ten years on us Everybody knew him,0.93,1.0
46,en-US,681.6099839999999,17.580032,Yeah What was our competitive advantage going to going to be So Um neither of them had any fruit So we decided OK let's let's put some money into making a really good high end pub scratch kitchen and Uh Yeah Successful,0.95,1.0
47,en-US,699.9699456,14.880051199999999,I'd say so Usually that was the biggest comment I would hear from people was Uh you know the beer was great but I enjoyed the fact that I had food there Yeah And Um that I'd say at the time when you did that that wasn't that common really,0.99,1.0
48,en-US,715.0000127999999,13.9199488,And still I guess to a certain degree isn't especially if a lot of these new upstarts it's Uh more of a food truck world Yeah In this area as a food truck world Yeah I would say that a lot of places now like you know Founders' is doing food every,0.98,1.0
49,en-US,729.76,20.5800448,I've noticed the more popular microbreweries become the more expectation of having a restaurant And people are expecting more of a brewpub than an actual brewery anymore So especially in Michigan when you have 400 of them Yep You know it's not like when I first started getting into the craft beer it was like I went to Pennsylvania and,0.98,1.0
50,en-US,750.3400448,13.44,stared at my uncle and we went to victory that huge gigantic brewery And it was cool They had a tasting room I could go in there and just try their beer on site How cool is that You can't get away with that in Michigan anymore,0.99,1.0
51,en-US,763.9000063999999,11.699968,It's now you need the whole experience It has to be a restaurant and a brewpub You know some people are interested in the tours but others aren't They're just trying to get a beer at the source type of thing,0.98,1.0
52,en-US,775.5999744,16.2700288,So it's a little different market now Yeah I'd agree I was just on vacation Uh with my wife and another couple And Um we are in Myrtle Beach and we did a Uh Side trip to Charleston actually we did two different side trips out to Charleston South Carolina,0.97,1.0
53,en-US,792.8,12.0300032,Uh So like half historical stuff and half hidden breweries and they have a big scene out there I was surprised Myrtle Beach not so much so Myrtle Beach vacation town There really isn't any kind of beer scene in there,0.99,1.0
54,en-US,804.8400383999999,18.829926399999998,A couple chains It doesn't really matter Uh But Charleston had lots of stuff going on and I wasn't real familiar I wouldn't say there's any names out there that Uh we would really know out here Um But I could tell you what I saw as we did about six breweries while we're out there every single one of them was in,0.99,1.0
55,en-US,823.6699648,18.870016,some industrial area where he had roll opened some garage doors and they were all making good beer Uh None of them had I'm sorry one of them had food Of the six we went to the rest were occasional food trucks none of which were on the days we were there because like one of the days was Monday and,0.97,1.0
56,en-US,842.6899968,13.5499776,Uh some of them weren't even open Mondays You know typically things we we would kind of see some of that here But yeah Wow And you know they'd survive that way Uh Pretty much just beer fact Only maybe one of those even had a winemaker's license,0.95,1.0
57,en-US,856.2500096,11.5200512,Most of them were just beer straight up which sucks because my wife doesn't drink beer So she's like what do I do At least we had a good driver and she's a good sport about it Right But Uh yeah that was totally their model there,0.99,1.0
58,en-US,868.3100159999999,15.6300288,Yeah And I think that's an up and coming market that it's a good example of Michigan's You know we've had microbreweries here now for 20 years Right And you know and even as early as 10 years ago I think that was the business model for Michigan,0.97,1.0
59,en-US,884.2699776,14.880051199999999,Yeah But as it got more competitive and more people had to figure out ways of bringing people in the restaurants were the natural next case So now that's kind of the expectations So I think you're starting to see that in Florida now too,1.0,1.0
60,en-US,899.4500608,13.3199872,Oh yeah that's another good example So Florida when I started going down there and hit microbreweries five six years ago it was just like that industrial area Roll-Up Doors taste the beer There was maybe I could get popcorn,0.99,1.0
61,en-US,912.9299967999999,12.709990399999999,You know now everywhere you know Cigar City has got a chain of restaurants And you know all these breweries are opening up with all this It's awesome food Don't get me wrong But it's now a requirement to be a restaurant on top of being a brewery,0.97,1.0
62,en-US,925.8500095999999,15.480012799999999,Yeah Yeah Yeah I'd say so I mean think about it When Kuhnen open up that second location they had food Yeah Um And Uh now look now dragging me does Yeah All right They partnered with somebody and definitely the regular Kunin and warn the other the original location,0.95,1.0
63,en-US,941.3300224,14.769971199999999,I mean they're a very regular with food trucks in there that probably if they didn't have that they'd probably be losing a lot of business Yeah for sure So yeah that's a real interesting observation that sometimes we probably forget that it's adjusted into that that realm here,0.99,1.0
64,en-US,956.5700095999999,12.329984,So let's talk about some of your progression then about kind of Uh beers you started with Yeah well it's like kind of get a little deeper into some of the beers you start with and kind of some of your fan favorites Um of what you guys been selling,0.97,1.0
65,en-US,968.8999935999999,11.0799872,And then let's get into the Oxford location that you just finally kind of open up And how fun is that We'll kind of get into that part of it here It wasn't fun opening it I'm saying it's fun now that it's open,0.97,1.0
66,en-US,979.9999488,9.930035199999999,Well it's fun for me When I saw you there like last month because I got to drink and enjoy it But it seemed simple to me of course because I didn't have to do anything right But it surely wasn't for you,0.99,1.0
67,en-US,989.929984,11.9100416,And you're obviously putting in some hours But let's talk about kind of some of your beers that kind of stood out right away Um Were you surprised by some of the the original beers you were brewing that those became more popular than others,0.99,1.0
68,en-US,1002.1400576,16.829952,Let's talk about some of those Um Well not not entirely I mean Uh we we call Ninja Chicken is our flagship beer So we always called that the beer Who built the brewery That was the beer from a home brew days that everybody wanted,0.98,1.0
69,en-US,1018.9700095999999,19.3200128,Everybody wanted to take it to their wedding their parties whatever football sundaes And so that was the first beer we brewed And then I was I'm a huge stout brown guy So our first our first lineup of like six beers were was ninja chicken a couple of stouts and a couple of browns,0.97,1.0
70,en-US,1038.8599808,15.089971199999999,Yeah Wow Yeah Talk about your preference Yeah So we're the ninja chicken name come from It's a great name Yeah So we were trying to think of a name for it And Uh me George and my wife and a few other people were at Um Buffalo Wild Wings and Ferndale,0.95,1.0
71,en-US,1054.6400256,13.319884799999999,And Uh because at the time we lived in Ferndale and Um well we you know we were one of Buffalo Wild Wings was in Ferndale Yeah that one on one mile Yeah Yeah I totally know it Yeah Um And we were getting tipsy and it was late,0.95,1.0
72,en-US,1067.9599104,12.27008,And we're eating chicken wings and all the TVs had Bruce Lee movies on Oh my gosh Okay So Um we're sitting there arguing over names and my wife Tammy just jumps up and goes we should call it ninja chicken,0.97,1.0
73,en-US,1080.3500032,11.1500288,Oh my gosh Really Yeah Oh that's awesome And everybody But George liked it OK so We all out voted George and then went with it Now it's you know it's a huge name Now who did the artwork for that,0.94,1.0
74,en-US,1092.2500095999999,12.7199232,Um Ian Burke Oh yeah Yeah You know what I have asked you that before That's right I know Ian Yeah So Detroit Beer Press the biggest thing and Um great freelance artist He does a lot of artwork for me Yeah,0.94,1.0
75,en-US,1104.9699328,8.6099968,I think I'm going to use him for some projects I have coming up with Motor City brew tours Uh My wife and I were just talking about that And she goes Who would you get And I'm like you know I was thinking of Ian Parr,0.97,1.0
76,en-US,1113.5799296,13.6500224,That's probably came out of our conversation where I'm sure I asked you that when I saw you last time out in the Oxford location about your artwork And I forgot that Ninja Chicken was his That's cool OK And what we're drinking here in Nice Beaver is one of my home brews too,0.98,1.0
77,en-US,1127.2900608,14.1898752,That's one of your home brews as well Yeah Yes it is my favorite brownie brewed at home So I carried this over to you know a lot of breweries seem to screw with Brownell's and like this is just a nice simple English brown ale Uh with a nice caramel malt in it,0.93,1.0
78,en-US,1142.0500992,14.639820799999999,Lower abv I honestly like when I first got in a beer that was definitely same thing Reds and browns and then porters and stouts as I you know And I still can drink all those any time now It's just a lot of breweries don't have them on draft on a regular basis,0.95,1.0
79,en-US,1156.930048,13.2999168,It's almost like it's seasonal or something to them which I always find kind of amusing Yeah I think with the big push into Uh IPAs and everything and the limited number of taps most breweries have you know the darker beers get pushed to the winner,0.94,1.0
80,en-US,1170.2500352,12.9599488,They definitely do don't they Yeah Yeah And I could always Uh I can always drink a good brown for sure And that's and that was my thought with Nice Beaver It's a nice four percent Brown is something you can drink year round,0.98,1.0

87,en-US,1280.4399104,13.2401152,which without any of the bitterness And that's where ninja chicken came from Right That's why they're so drinkable Yeah And I kind of joke because that's the same thing as the New England IPA So I joke that ninja chicken is actually a clear New England IPA,0.97,1.0
88,en-US,1293.6999936,20.36992,I just had ever thought about it Interesting because the same thing New England IPAs aren't really apas because the the bitterness is so low on them Right Um But so Um Um Eric at the time my assistant he was a total hophead so I started letting him brew a few IPAs and we started rolling those out,0.95,1.0
89,en-US,1314.5500671999998,14.6199552,Um Our next really big hit was Skjervøy Dan OK so blood orange is huge right now Well when you did it though that was kind of novel wasn't it It was five years ago Oh my God Yeah OK I didn't think of that,0.98,1.0
90,en-US,1329.1899904,21.1800064,Wow Five years ago we made our first Blood Orange IPA way ahead of the curve on this Um and Uh went over like gangbusters And Um we still keep it as a summer seasonal Actually just came out this week OK Um And we usually Uh it's our number one seller during the summer and we only have it for six months,0.98,1.0
91,en-US,1350.6700288,16.0198656,So it outsells everything for the full year in six months Wow That's amazing to me Yeah OK That just shows the power of the IPA though Yeah And yeah the blood orange and everything else And we finally have a little following on it,0.99,1.0
92,en-US,1366.6898944,13.4701056,So we actually do launch dates like you do in Oberon and everything so It's pretty professional Yeah Yeah We coordinate We coordinated a throw bar is putting on tap all at once OK Oh that's cool Well that takes some work,0.94,1.0
93,en-US,1380.1899008,20.8200704,Yeah No wonder you're doing 16 hour days Yeah Um So so scurvy Dan's been real well for you So let's let's leave that into Uh Oxford location and let's kind of talk about the the you know how to go all deep into it but like the progression of it of Uh because you live out on that end of town,0.97,1.0
94,en-US,1401.0699776,19.2,I can I see the appeal of you having something out there And when you first Uh presented to do that there definitely wasn't another brewery out there at that time right Yeah And so what happened is when we started the brewery in Warren I lived in Ferndale Um but my wife had horses,0.98,1.0
95,en-US,1420.6199808,16.219955199999998,OK so we decided to go horse trails or pastures in Ferndale No no So we decided to go and buy property So we we bought property up in Goodrich and Um top pops up farm Yep Yeah Only a few miles away from where I lived in Goodrich,0.96,1.0
96,en-US,1436.8600064,18.390016,Wow OK And Um that allowed me to stay on I 75 so I could get to the brewery very easily So a few years into Warna we couldn't keep up with distribution So we had ninja chicken and and Buffalo Wild Wings,0.96,1.0
97,en-US,1455.2500224,18.2098944,We had scurvy darn all over the region We just couldn't keep up So what was happening is on our little ten barrel system and warn in the summer while we brewed was made of chicken and Sacirbey Dan And so here I have eight taps but I only can keep three or four running because I can't brew anything,0.93,1.0
98,en-US,1473.4599168,18.46016,else because that's what selling So we decided to look for another place to Um do a distribution center and we decided since I was the head brewer it should be up by me so I can get to it easier than driving the hour down to warn,0.98,1.0
99,en-US,1492.4000256,14.399999999999999,So that's how we kind of chose that area Now when I was up there I approached Uh Ortonville Davisson Lapeer Oxford Lake all those communities and talked to them about opening brewery And Uh so how does that process work then,0.95,1.0
100,en-US,1506.8000256,13.429964799999999,As you do that do you go to like a city council meeting Is that how something like Yeah Most of them have a village manager or a Uh downtown development authority and they're kind of the front line of Yes we you know we have interests,0.99,1.0
101,en-US,1520.2400255999999,20.519935999999998,We have interest in this Um You know they'll get you to the right people to OK your plans and OK forth Um So coming out of that Um 50 51 North was already in Lake Worryin And I knew knew those guys really well because they opened at the same time,0.98,1.0
102,en-US,1540.7599616,16.11008,We didn't warn We argue all the time who was brewery number one Twenty seven versus number 128 because we both got our notification at the same time and the same day we were sitting sitting in a conference room in Kalamazoo at the Michigan Brewers Guild Conference,0.96,1.0
103,en-US,1557.4700031999998,13.5300096,And my phone went off in Adam's phone went off Oh that's wild Yeah That's the first time I met you I believe was at that conference the winter conference I I don't know if it was that exact one or the one after that,0.99,1.0
104,en-US,1571.0000128,13.949952,I can't recall kind of blends together But yeah I prefer Uh talking to you about You were working on a brewery Yeah So how funny OK so you got that notice Yeah So that's exciting So that kind of dropped Lake Aurion out of the search,0.95,1.0
105,en-US,1586.9599744,15.5400192,Um And Uh in one of my requirements was I grew up in a small town I grew up in Chelsea OK And Uh we Um the reason we didn't open the brewery in Chelsea is because Chelsea ALEhouse was already working on it,0.98,1.0
106,en-US,1602.7400192,14.839910399999999,They weren't open at the time but I didn't feel right trying to come in to the town to Um And that they've just moved They're still in Chelsea but now they're in there Yeah they were sort of down they went downtown instead of out by the clock,0.94,1.0
107,en-US,1617.8799616,14.2800896,Yeah Yeah I was there Uh Loof December maybe And I did up your history talk out there on like a Tuesday Great great I love those guys They've a private groups in there a few times and they're a good asset to that community out there,0.95,1.0
108,en-US,1632.189952,14.6400256,Oh yeah sure So I see why you would have been hesitant in that scenario Yeah but I wanted to get I loved downtown Chelsea And though walking around you know it's the same kind of thing like Royal Oak you know the walking around in Ferndale and all that,0.97,1.0
109,en-US,1646.8299776,21.1800064,So the Warren breweries in this really industrial area and we get no foot traffic And you know we're there and we have a tiny parking lot is all hampering us So my search is for I wanted to be in a more downtown community to do this and Um or at least off the beaten path but closer to a,0.95,1.0
110,en-US,1668.009984,18.2800384,downtown like that because when I started I was looking for a strictly production I wasn't we weren't even really thinking about having a tasting room when we first start looking And then Uh when I talked to Oxford they're like we really want you downtown because I was looking at a building just off of downtown,0.97,1.0
111,en-US,1686.2900224,20.2899456,And they're like no no no We'll find you a building downtown We want you downtown Oh wow So they were really pushing for it Yeah so Um Went to Ortonville Ortonville was awesome I really wanted to go to Ortonville found a great building Premiere Ortonville they have no well or sewer so would have been septic or I should,0.96,1.0
112,en-US,1706.579968,15.809945599999999,say they don't have their own water system or sewer So it would have been septic and well water and Oakland County was like no you can't put that much water into the septic system and millions of dollars to do it right and there's like no local,0.96,1.0
113,en-US,1722.5699327999998,15.4099712,Yeah Like big time money Yeah it's not going to work And then I started talking to Loopier and found out until that access was already playing and going in Um And then with Oxford really begging us to come I was like OK it's Oxford,0.96,1.0
114,en-US,1739.0000128,19.5600384,And Uh true to their word they found us a building right downtown in a great area great park great off a great big parking lot And Uh that's and that's how that all started out OK so obviously the nuts and bolts and saga of getting that open took you know way longer than you would have probably thought of,0.98,1.0
115,en-US,1758.5600511999999,17.580032,But you're open more open now officially open What is it about a month ago now Just before St. Patrick's Day and just before all I'm sorry Yeah just before St. Patrick's Day There we go How cool And yeah it was real funny timing that Uh when I saw you last Um at the brewery was on that opening stretch and,0.96,1.0
116,en-US,1776.1400832,12.1798656,I was out at the other brewery Uh on the same side street few doors down homegrown doing this Uh beer history talk that I had set up months and months ago All right Um And Uh so I don't normally get to do something like that,0.97,1.0
117,en-US,1788.3199488,11.820032,Like I have a beer there I talked to a real cool crowd which is the Oakland Township Historical Society Uh And then I got to come over and hang out with you Um in the new taproom So I got to see everything,0.97,1.0
118,en-US,1800.9800704,14.3798272,Uh Wow Like what a night and day difference between you know what the space you had in Warren space you have in Warren And you know what you were what you've been working with in Oxford in terms of you know you can sprout your brewing equipment you can get some nicer equipment in there and do your thing,0.97,1.0
119,en-US,1815.379968,14.550016,So talk a bit about that system and the space in there and what people can expect when they come out to the Oxford tasting room Yeah So you know we wanted to do this one right You know we knew Warren was you know every dollar we could scrape up we threw into it,0.99,1.0
120,en-US,1829.9299839999999,11.3700864,But it was still you know we built everything by hand is still kind of a rundown building in an industrial area So sure those are things you can overcome Right right right There's nothing you could do about that,0.94,1.0
121,en-US,1841.4798847999998,22.230016,So we decided to go into this and make a brand spanking new by brand new equipment Um custom build everything and make it And we're going for like kind of a rustic look the perfect fit the town So the first thing we started off is we called craftwork and bought a brand new Um seven barrel system,0.96,1.0
122,en-US,1865.2399616,19.260006399999998,Um It sounds like we're going down in Verilog But the difference is in Warren we had two fermenters and one bright tank and Oxford we have six fermenters and three bright tanks Yeah Wow So we're working and we're actually going from brewing 400 barrels a year or two 600 barrels a year,0.94,1.0
123,en-US,1884.7098879999999,20.6501888,That's I mean even though the system's a little bit smaller OK we can just pump them out that fast And that system Yeah You got more efficiency Oh yeah The efficiency is insane Uh Yeah Um You know we're running From a beer standpoint we're running at like 68 percent efficiency in the warning system here we're running 85 percent efficient,0.95,1.0
124,en-US,1905.4200832,20.1299968,That's a huge difference It's a huge jump So and Uh you know to the layman that's lowers your costs It's a better product Um less ingredients more control Uh more consistent What would I guess I never really thought about what would like a mackerel brewer be in efficiency percentages you think,0.96,1.0
125,en-US,1926.360064,11.0700544,I feel like I never get to hear that when I do some of those you know huge brewery tours I would bet that they're pushing they're probably pushing 90 Yeah they're probably in that 90 Yeah that makes sense,0.97,1.0
126,en-US,1937.4600191999998,15.7200384,So the fact that you're where you are in the mid to high 80s isn't this great Yeah Yeah as far as I know I mean Griffing clause the the one brewery that is Um there efficiency's just out of this world is like 95 96 percent,0.94,1.0
127,en-US,1953.4798847999998,16.050176,But they bought this custom Uh green press Very similar with that big money Oh big money Beautiful I would love to have it but I'm sure there's only like five in the entire world or something like that I remember reading all about it when I first opened and I've been through that brewery,0.97,1.0
128,en-US,1969.5300608,14.8598784,And they Uh actually just last weekend I did a charity bike event that I do annually And I Griffin Clore is my sponsor of that Um So that's funny you say Graffin Claw So like last weekend for example we had 500 bikers because the weather was so nice,0.92,1.0
129,en-US,1984.4100096,13.4699008,We leave from Clubhouse BFD and Rochester Hills and we bike on the Clinton River in the Pinkard trails And at the halfway point the Pink Creek Cider Mill it's kind of halfway to Lake Aurion Uh They get a griffin cloth beer and two donuts and then they get another beer at the back,0.91,1.0
130,en-US,1997.8799104,16.620134399999998,And so we went through a thousand donuts and a thousand beers Wow Um But talk about efficiency because they sell Uh Um Norm's gateway and blue sky in 15 packs now That's what we bought We just bought a thousand of those basically Uh for the evant,0.95,1.0
131,en-US,2014.5000447999998,10.979942399999999,Like talk about efficient Yeah You know not a lot of breweries can do it that way but it's because of how they set themselves up And then they'll be more efficient because they're open up that second facility which was next to where we started the event,0.98,1.0
132,en-US,2026.2600704,11.279974399999999,Yeah And that clubhouse Yeah HandsOn being a sponsor So long story short I get it about the efficiency And I think to most people Uh they just want to have good beer and they don't always think about all those things,0.94,1.0
133,en-US,2037.5400447999998,14.9098496,But you as a business owner and you're trying to you know make money Uh that maximizing your costs you want to maximize your investment And this and Uh a lot of people just don't always think about that They just think why can't you get more beer out to me quicker,0.97,1.0
134,en-US,2052.48,15.4198016,Right Yeah So at the Oxford location you know that's Uh a cool part of it Right So how many taps do you have there So we put 48 taps in Wow That's a lot Yeah Um Now people ask me all the time how are you going to keep forty eight taps running,0.97,1.0
135,en-US,2068.4398592,21.7800704,OK We have no expectation of 48 taps of different beers Um You have to understand we have the longest burn Oakland County It is 68 feet long That's crazy When you say that's about like that's amazing When I walked in I just like wow this really keeps going,0.95,1.0
136,en-US,2090.2500351999997,18.1200896,Yeah So Uh first off our main beers will be replicated on to different banks a tap so the bartenders don't have to walk 20 miles a day to pour beers I'm sure they appreciate that Yeah And then we're also doing nitrous taps or we'll have nitrogen beers on tap,0.94,1.0
137,en-US,2108.3701247999998,16.799744,We're going to put all our wine on tap We have a wine license there Um And eventually we're going to do sodas And those are all be on tap So the goal is to maintain around twenty four beers at all times Um with some being doubled up with some being doubled up,0.96,1.0
138,en-US,2125.2900864,12.6599168,And then the rest will be wines and sodas and stuff like that Do you plan to ever dabble with hard cider What that since you got the wine list We do We have cider Um actually worn is pretty much turned into a cider,0.97,1.0
139,en-US,2138.3999488,10.8199936,Oh interesting I didn't pick up on that before OK Yeah Oh very cool Yeah So we're pretty much just doing cider in Warren in our license allows us to move it back and forth between locations It does OK,0.96,1.0
140,en-US,2149.2299776,11.3901568,And then we just brew all the beer up in Oxford So that's kind of how we're doing it So because you have a brewery license and a winery license why at both locations Oh OK I got it So you have the dual license at both,0.95,1.0
141,en-US,2160.6299648,11.6701184,It allows you to do that OK I feel like I don't always understand that even though I get it explained to me a lot It's like it leaves my brain as fast as it goes in there Right But I understand the winery license part of it,0.97,1.0
142,en-US,2172.6001152,12.119859199999999,So for the wine then are you Uh buying that from someone else and you're just serving it on site No we make it or you are making that too OK Oh very cool Did you know much about making wine,0.96,1.0
143,en-US,2184.9899007999998,12.720127999999999,No I know nothing about wine I appreciate your honesty OK No I hired a home winemaker The idea to do it now Some of them are Some of them are simple kids and some of them are He went and got,0.94,1.0
144,en-US,2198.649856,11.0901248,Grapes during harvest and made a few Oh that's fun So OK now we have a good mix of stuff Oh cool Well that's why I can't wait to bring my wife in there my non beer drinking wine Yeah,0.96,1.0
145,en-US,2210.0199423999998,17.9699712,So she can have some fun with that Uh That's a good So did you see an immediate need for that then by coming into Oxford that you couldn't just do beer No it was just something I always wanted to do because even in Warren we were just always asked about beer,0.99,1.0
146,en-US,2228.1101312,15.5697152,Sure Um I was always getting a winery license because I'm a cider nut I love hard cider OK I'm a big fan So with my wife being Uh a non beer drinker she loves cider And it's made me you know try to get uber smart about it,0.97,1.0
147,en-US,2243.6798464,14.430207999999999,And we're really living in a cool time now Um I mean you're a good example You're making cider So I'd say five six years ago that would have been nonexistent You just wouldn't see it would have been a very novel novel idea to see a brewery really do that,0.99,1.0
148,en-US,2258.5300991999998,12.9599488,Yeah Now lots of breweries have kind of stuck their toe in the water and Uh they're doing that Um I used to go to I don't know if you remember it cost plus world market I do Yeah So the futon in my basement from cost plus worth,0.96,1.0
149,en-US,2271.5400191999997,12.7801344,Oh nice They were the first place I ever saw Um that Did custom six packs Oh yeah You know that's a good point It probably was for me too when I lived in Chicago That would be my big thrill,0.98,1.0
150,en-US,2284.329984,9.569894399999999,I lived out in the west suburbs and I go to the one in Naperville Illinois and that was my fun was going in there as well before we had a lot of stores where you could do that Uh Yeah,1.0,1.0
151,en-US,2294.2599167999997,16.050176,And I always went to the one in Ann Arbor and in Wesleyan Oak And Uh they and I they used to have a whole row of hard cider is from around the world And so I started trying you know like Woodpecker from England some German sliders,0.9,1.0
152,en-US,2310.3100928,16.499916799999998,And that was when I Uh discovered Woodchuck And now that woodchuck in woodpecker kind of combine now And they're one company They are doing some amazing specialty sliders now Uh They're ginger sliders all this world They're doing all these seasonals,0.89,0.995
153,en-US,2326.8100096,11.6699136,They're barrel aging now And it's just oh it's just it's awesome You know it's funny though that probably a lot of people don't give them the respect No I mean they really were doing that when no one was doing that in America,0.99,1.0
154,en-US,2339.4699264,13.2900864,Uh And now with Uh I think when Agger Audra came out of the market so the Boston Beer Company brand Um and they kind of they probably pushed would chuck out of a lot of markets with the scale they have That's probably unfortunate,0.94,1.0
155,en-US,2352.8400896,11.710054399999999,Yeah I think I'm sure it also made Woodchuck step up their game more because there's definitely a lot of more one offs They're doing seasonal things that are really good I'd say their distribution has probably gotten affected though,0.96,1.0
156,en-US,2365.2100096,19.3099776,Yeah And your orchard Yeah Good bad indifferent And I think what's happened What's the other one Um Strongbow Yeah Oh yes Strombo and that now if you notice like Strombo has really come almost like reintroduce themselves back into the market with Uh not English style,0.91,1.0

166,en-US,2503.980032,21.3901312,is fun Yeah And then it's it's actually saved a lot of orchards So you know there is a few years ago where we had the bad weather in the orchards lost all their crops and everything and now they're they're either doing their own hard cider or they're dedicated to selling custom blends to breweries or Sirees or wineries,0.96,1.0
167,en-US,2525.3701631999998,17.669939199999998,You know what I mean Sure Um Yeah I know That's what Motor City Brew works does in downtown Detroit Uh They've been making cider for a long time But Uh the Dan Uh one of the partners there he's kind of a cider nerd too now and loves to talk about crazy you know heirloom apple trees and things and stuff that I,0.97,1.0

169,en-US,2553.4199808,16.709836799999998,Like what ten years ago Yeah I don't know something like that So I'm excited to see how that progresses That's and that's one of my things I want to progress to So in a couple of years I'm really hoping to spin off a cider company and open a location just for cider and wine,0.98,1.0
170,en-US,2570.1298176,14.8801536,And I think it's common Uh When I was in Chicago my wife and I were in Chicago Uh last right around right before Christmas We went to this Uh amazing cider bar They had their the name just totally eludes me But it was in like a real cool trendy area,0.98,1.0
171,en-US,2585.4599168,15.0601728,And Uh wow their list was just I'll bet you they had a 20 page list of stuff There were so many things on there I had never heard of was very international local and international and Uh Wow I mean we dropped some coin let me tell you at a time out there,0.97,1.0
172,en-US,2600.5200895999997,11.279974399999999,But that was like her day Right Like my wife doesn't get to do it in that capacity And I think there's a lot of people out there that would do that that would go there and they would you know enjoy cider all in,1.0,1.0
173,en-US,2612.1000959999997,8.8799232,I mean he pretty much got to be all and they had some beers but I didn't dare drink on while I was there with her Right I was all in for cider And I think you're right I think we're going to see more of that,0.97,1.0
174,en-US,2621.5800832,14.189977599999999,For sure Absolutely In Michigan now they have what is it Is it Michigan Cider Association Or maybe it's hard cider association There is an association now of all the cider makers here in Michigan I feel like I'm not saying the acronym,0.99,1.0
175,en-US,2635.7700608,14.699929599999999,Right like yeah I don't know M.K. I don't know And they've been doing these cider weeks aren't really out in Grand Rapids where Vanimo Space started And Um in fact I think that starts this week or next week They have about a week's worth of fun stuff,0.94,1.0
176,en-US,2650.4699904,10.620108799999999,And they've done some cider festivals kind of you know to a lesser degree What Blake's is definitely don't want their cider days Yeah Uh Which is another place I remember seeing you at last summer last year I love Cider Days,0.94,1.0
177,en-US,2661.1202048,16.7796736,Yeah that's a lot of fun I mean there they have I mean what a great place to do that at because they pretty much have all the space you'd ever want to do something like that Dontae I mean if you just had this huge farm Uh I took a group out there first time I got to bring a,0.98,1.0
178,en-US,2677.8998784,10.2002688,Buster group and there was on St. Patrick's Day actually I'm if I was telling you about that when I saw you last Fall and I basically went up Van Dike and I did Brooks Bruen and Browny and Brewhouse,0.9,1.0
179,en-US,2688.1001472,11.010048,And then we continued on to Blake's And Uh I hadn't seen all their equipment They've been adding back in there Have you seen all that Oh yeah It's totally amazing I mean I've been to Seider days like the last one,0.96,1.0
180,en-US,2699.1101952,13.949952,They've done that about three years now Uh But I had never gone back in there I was I was blown away And The Cider Maker and some awesome staff were hanging out We had like 30 people with us And I ended up being a real nice day on St. Patrick's Day,0.97,1.0
181,en-US,2713.6600064,17.619968,And while we were they were pouring pictures of cider right out of fermenters to us We were kind of in second haven't I They've really kind of blown up the varieties Yeah And they're really experimenting I guess that's the power of having Uh a good investment backbone in what they're doing,0.95,1.0
182,en-US,2731.3000448,10.950041599999999,Meaning they already have a great business out there They added this into it So now they're not scared to throw money at it right now Call it what you want That's definitely what they're doing And they've put a lot of product out in the marketplace,0.98,1.0
183,en-US,2742.2500864,10.2899712,And I'm sure they've I'd say like on this side of the state Uh they got to be selling the most cider And I'd say on the west side it would be probably you know Vanderbilt is probably doing a huge percentage,0.95,1.0
184,en-US,2752.5400575999997,10.5601024,But I would say you know prior to that phantasmal was popping themselves up on the east side here And I would say that's probably less now as a result of what Blake's has been doing Right And I Wouldn't you agree a little,0.96,1.0
185,en-US,2763.1101952,11.269734399999999,Yeah I think so Yeah Yeah It's not that you know I like both and and I'm rooting for both of them trust me But Uh that's the power of the scale I think that makes it kind of started They're pumping it out like crazy,0.96,1.0
186,en-US,2774.3899647999997,17.180057599999998,Yeah Yeah I'd say even at first I Uh might have been skeptical and Uh I'm not anymore for sure I'm really kind of bought into that so that when I hear you talking about it you're excited about it That gets that gives me a lot of hope that you know there's I believe there's probably more brewers that feel that,0.98,1.0
187,en-US,2791.5700223999997,20.9600512,way So that being said What do you think of the Brewers Guild Pretty much cut inside or out from festivals and I don't want to put you in a spot to say anything bad about the guilt Just in general like what's your thoughts of OK you're a member of the Michigan Brewers Guild and it's a beer festival,0.98,1.0
188,en-US,2812.9200127999998,11.209932799999999,and obviously they've tried to keep it that way Yeah a little bit of is kind of easten there but they've always really limited that to be like if you're a brewery you could how I used to work when you could have one cider on,0.96,1.0
189,en-US,2824.1399807999996,23.5999232,Is that correct Right Yeah Yeah that was it Right Yeah And this has been a discussion for the last couple of years with the Guild And Um you know I kind of see it both ways I mean I personally gave my opinion was the guild should evolve into encompassing all craft alcoholic products for the state of Michigan,0.99,1.0
190,en-US,2847.7499392,25.4500864,It should become more of a Allana what Michigan Alcoholics Guild or alcohol You know what I mean But yeah I totally understand what you mean Um But Its foundation is a Brewers Guild so I completely understand their standpoint of we're here to support breweries not wineries not Cytori is not distilleries are our trade group in our bread and,0.94,1.0
191,en-US,2873.2000255999997,18.089983999999998,butter is brewery So I completely understand that And they've done great things for our breweries And their festivals are the only ones that are actually like licensed with the state Oh they're they're the best ones Yeah And you know I've been to lots of festivals so we know what we're talking about,0.98,1.0
192,en-US,2891.3201151999997,14.669824,They get they get special permits and treatment from the state just for their festivals where you know you go to these other festivals and Uh you know their brand is a charity basically in order to put the festival on most everyone including the charity,0.99,1.0
193,en-US,2905.9899391999998,13.0400256,Bykov and I just ran last weekend for me to hand out a beer like that I'm working for a nonprofit and that's the model of pretty much everything else right outside of what the guild does Right So I I completely understand their point,0.97,1.0
194,en-US,2919.04,20.2500096,They don't want to disrupt that whole thing They got a good thing going with the MALKY and and really their focus is beer So let them focus 100 percent on beer I mean if you no offense to other breweries but if you really want to be a cider company then be cytochrome go be a cider company or,0.94,1.0
195,en-US,2939.5900416,16.1398784,form another company that's cider company and then join the Cider Guild Sure And work it that way so I can see both sides Yeah I guess it's a progression of those other industries And they all want to feel like they're part of that growth,0.98,1.0
196,en-US,2956.2099712,10.8300288,And as they've as more people have gotten into those other aspects or breweries have dabbled in both of that then they just want to do it all in the same place I see the convenience in that to a consumer,0.98,1.0
197,en-US,2967.4899456,13.530111999999999,The consumer doesn't care do they They know I think they just want to try what they want to try So to them it's like whatever Um So for example Uh my friend Paul Starr Uh just did beer fest at the ballpark,0.99,1.0
198,en-US,2981.4099968,11.219968,And Uh you know he brings kind of everything in on that he has made He has cider sometimes has some spirits or even a little bit of wine at times And he does that because people have kind of asked for it,0.96,1.0
199,en-US,2992.8701951999997,15.1197696,Right Like my wife doesn't go to any of the guild festivals because she doesn't drink beer And sobeit the girl festivals are busy and they're great and I love them and I'll continue to go to them But Uh all that leaves opportunities for some of these other festival organizers decide how they do that,0.96,1.0
200,en-US,3008.2299903999997,12.929843199999999,Right Um Or like a Blakes that does like a cider days or like being nectar that does like the mead festivals And they invite other people at times you know to mix into some of those things Uh Those are the opportunities that are out there,0.95,1.0
201,en-US,3021.1598335999997,17.7600512,Then the guild just doesn't have to be in that And they stay focused on what they're good at All right The Guild ultimately is the Michigan Brewers Trade Association Right There are trade group there backing breweries So they should focus on beer in brewing in the wine industry,0.96,1.0
202,en-US,3038.9198847999996,16.6301696,Has their own trade group Yeah You know people need to understand Michigan wine was growing and become in micro wine in craft wine long before the craft beer movement Very true And I was doing what I was going to wineries more before I was going to breweries,0.96,1.0
203,en-US,3055.5701248,18.809856,Yeah The Michigan wine scene has been growing growing growing And then the craft beer scene came in and now the craft distillers sings coming distillery scenes coming in and they all kind of cannibalize from each other Right So surely the wine trade group was pissed at the beer trade group because they're pulling market share,0.96,1.0
204,en-US,3075.120128,24.609792,So and now the distillery you know people are pulling shares away from the breweries It's a cycle of life in in the industry Um But it's another argument for just be a beer trade group and support that beer industry Um and let the wine people support the wine people the distillery people support the distillery people and do what's best,0.97,1.0
205,en-US,3099.7299199999998,13.1100672,for your constituency's or your members or however you want to sound Yeah that's that's all It's a good business case for that I really get that Yeah And Uh that's a good discussion because all that's just happened was kind of timely in my head,0.96,1.0
206,en-US,3112.8399872,12.1800704,I really haven't had a show since I know that that came down or at least the change is going to be made Yeah I think it would be awesome to have one encompassing Um entity for everybody who makes some sort of alcohol in the state,0.99,1.0
207,en-US,3125.0200575999997,12.9599488,But at the same time who do they focus on Because the laws are different between each one of their licensing different tax Yeah Yeah everything's different between those industries So I feel like you couldn't do that No I don't think it would work,0.99,1.0
208,en-US,3138.1899264,12.949913599999999,Someone had suggested that to me one time I thought I don't understand how you would do it for sure Yeah Oh how very interesting Uh OK well we're rocking along here How far along are we Oh we're like 15 minutes in,0.98,1.0
209,en-US,3151.13984,16.4102144,Amazing Uh That's how it works though once you get talking Oh and alcohol isn't it Uh So let's talk about Uh what else you're working on with falling down So you got the war on location You got what you're doing in Oxford Uh but you also got stuff in distribution,0.93,1.0
210,en-US,3167.5500543999997,17.0100736,So let's talk a bit about how you're working hard to get some things out and distribution some draft and packaged and Uh who you work with to do that Yeah So Um you know the whole reason for Oxford is distribution was blowing up and Uh this is just draft sales,0.97,1.0
211,en-US,3185.3400063999998,23.0397952,So we wanted to Um use Oxford as our new distribution point and everything else Well we opened Oxford and it's all sold out We can't keep IBM bam Same problem Yeah same problem just on a larger scale So we're now doing Uh contract brewing with a couple of other breweries,0.96,1.0
212,en-US,3208.7099392,12.4499968,Uh The biggest one right now is Hirschson Zealand out Marysville and they have a big set up in there I brought people through there that used to be an old Uh was at a hostess Uh It was a hostess factory building,0.94,1.0
213,en-US,3221.2799488,13.340262399999999,Yeah it's got a great area They got system 20 barrels system It's it's nice mill room lots of cooling I'm just like man this like it's what I so want this You want one of those in your backyard,0.95,1.0
214,en-US,3234.820096,19.669811199999998,Yeah I just wish it wasn't in Marysville Yeah I understand But Um now a great guy is And Uh so we brew Um scurvy Dan there OK Um And we so we can pump it out 20 barrels at a time In fact that's where I was coming from today when I was late is Uh our first twenty barrel batch of the summer,0.95,1.0
215,en-US,3254.4899072,15.6301312,was getting kicked up and our distributors already bought it all So the whole batch is gone already Wow So we have another bad break Thank you And Uh it looks like that's just going to be a dedicated facility of the Bruce Gerbi Dam for six months,0.94,1.0
216,en-US,3271.300096,16.1298432,Dam OK so you got So that was the first label approval you pushed for then Is that Um so we're not caning yet Oh I'm sorry That is still all draft OK That's all dry Our goal is July to be canning scurvy Dan and we will be canning it out there,0.92,1.0
217,en-US,3287.4299392,11.2500736,And we'll probably start with Michigan Mobile And Uh and then because they don't work up tomorrow they don't have a canning line there No Okay Now they don't have anything for package there Oh they don't have anything for packaging,0.93,1.0
218,en-US,3298.6800128,9.690112,I guess I didn't think about that All right Yeah They just kind of they hand can a few things and they can bottle a few things for special releases but that's about it Oh that's what I've seen that,0.94,1.0
219,en-US,3308.3701247999998,10.829824,Yeah When I brought a group out there I want to say it was last last year like in January January yeah Uh that's right Some people bought some bottles I guess I didn't think about it at Just hand bottle,0.96,1.0
220,en-US,3319.2300544,12.7698944,Yeah They don't really distribute them They're the sell at the pub there Um So yeah I was thinking Michigan Mobile to start out and we'll get some cans of scurvy Dan test the market in cans and then ninja chicken the follow up behind that,0.93,1.0
221,en-US,3332.009984,13.23008,So I'm I'm hoping to start bringing ninja chicken out there this summer too Okay cool Well I look forward to seeing more of that in the market because I'd say it's been a challenge as you stated for to find it anywhere outside of your toponyms,0.96,1.0
222,en-US,3345.449984,17.0100736,Yeah it's it's real tough I mean we've Um had Buffalo Wild Wings Uh We going to a franchise there We were in six locations all winter Uh serving Ninja Chicken Um We're now in Blakroc the steakhouse Oh yeah we're in several of their locations,0.93,1.0
223,en-US,3363.8701056,15.9899648,Um So we're starting to get chain interest Uh rather than just the little craft beer Uh pubs Seems like that's a good angle as to be in a chain with that The chains want that Yeah they want to have a cool local brand that you know people are going to dig,0.97,1.0
224,en-US,3380.9999872,9.8701312,Um That makes perfect sense to me Yeah So doubling down on our marketing and everything So instead of like generic tap handles you know we have custom ninja chicken tap handles Now I need one of those by the way,0.98,1.0

226,en-US,3404.460032,13.2898816,But I still do it I mainly focus I'd say on Michigan brands though which is fine And we have lots of options And then folks like yourself create cool tap handles and makes me never want to stop So that's a good problem,0.98,1.0
227,en-US,3417.8701312,9.7398784,Well make sure you get one Uh See that's why I that's why I say it on air So it's on record Someone there you use the power I have or what Or at least the power I think I have,0.95,1.0
