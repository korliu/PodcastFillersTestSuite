0,en-US,3.15,22.939999999999998,Welcome to design story where we have conversations with the brightest and boldest thought leaders about design and how it affects our lives and shapes the world all around us Here's your host Jenny Herberger I am so fortunate today to have a wonderful lady on the show,1.0,1.0
1,en-US,27.02,13.32,Uh Miss Moira Cohen is on the show with me today And Uh you get you're just going to love having this conversation So Moira thank you so much for being on the show today Well thanks Jenny I'm really excited to talk with you,0.95,1.0
2,en-US,41.0,21.9900032,One of the things that I wanted to really bring up There's so much conversation right now that surrounds the idea that design is powerful that you know the messages that are put out there Uh the ideology the methodology that design offers us is powerful in and of itself,1.0,1.0
3,en-US,63.26,17.3900032,But what you've said to me in the past which I think is so great is that design actually is power not just power full Yes so Um well design is transformative I truly believe that you know it changes people in products and brands,0.97,1.0
4,en-US,81.3099968,23.64,And but the interesting thing is that the power that we certainly as designers understand and appreciate it stays just as potential unless it can be really actualized and realized So especially in companies So this is something and I think this is the challenge Um that we've made a lot of progress in it but certainly a challenge still that,0.99,1.0
5,en-US,105.24999679999999,16.56,designers find today when we know and even in the media there's all this you know the the real hype as you mentioned about designs role competitive advantage But then when you get down to the day to day to my project with this business colleague how does it affect me,0.97,1.0
6,en-US,121.83999999999999,22.3800064,How do you really help them understand and to really you know let unleash that power appropriately So it's been something that I've really followed in over my career I remember out of necessity So when I first Um coming out of different aspects of design being on the agency side at Pentagram being head of design at Otis College of,0.99,1.0
7,en-US,144.2200064,15.990003199999999,Art and Design in L.A. and then moving being recruited to Hallmark that was my first kind of experience in a real corporation design inside if you will And I just you know I can I can remember it today,0.98,1.0
8,en-US,160.48,21.72,It was such a different world because all of a sudden you know the language the acronyms the KPIs and the cagers and all of this conversation And Um so and then you know when you really started to realize that designers were really even though Hallmark was a very creative company they were marginalized in the in the overall culture,0.98,1.0
9,en-US,182.2,15.7500032,which was very much a kind of And I felt this more and more so at Coca-Cola which is my next stop Being recruited into Coke was very much about a command and control environment that really is about predictability and consistency and operational efficiency,0.98,1.0
10,en-US,198.2499968,13.6100096,And so where does design fit in this place you know and how can it power really be realized So I started to think about you know it actually it started through a series of presentations Um that I was asked to develop,0.98,1.0
11,en-US,211.86999039999998,16.7100032,And then the topic I started to dove into and I initially kind of looking at this idea of a seat at the table because everyone was talking about at the time So this I think was about the early mid 2000s when I was at Hallmark and you know getting a seat at the table,0.99,1.0
12,en-US,228.5799936,14.730009599999999,What was the design needed to have a seat at the table Well what did that really mean You know it was actually it was a statement of power a recognition of power But what did it mean So in learning more about that I understood you know the kind of a sense of the metaphor that that meant and,0.97,1.0
13,en-US,243.31000319999998,14.3099904,the power of metaphor the power of language and how language frames our behavior And so I came away with some questions So Well what is the real language of design other than maybe the way designers talk about it,1.0,1.0
14,en-US,257.9800064,16.769996799999998,And then what is the metaphor that we as designers can use to kind of help shape the perceptions of others i.e. you know our business colleagues So and I really started diving into this idea of power and what is power,1.0,1.0
15,en-US,275.350016,16.079974399999998,Right So right Because it's really interesting What you're what you're bringing up right now is is something that we talk about so much in current day design Uh profession And that is this idea of having a seat at the table,0.99,1.0
16,en-US,291.7000192,24.389964799999998,Well that you know now we have one And now what we do with that is just a question in and of itself But going back to when you're talking about when we were in essence kind of you know fighting for that seat at the table and you're right it really is about power and and empowering ourselves to,0.99,1.0
17,en-US,316.08998399999996,18.450022399999998,be able to be a part of that conversation early on So it doesn't surprise me at all that that made you start thinking about what is this in the first place Right So I mean if if it's if power is just simply if it's the ability to kind of affect the behavior of others so you get the,1.0,1.0
18,en-US,334.5400064,19.109990399999997,outcome that you want or that your team wants or that the strategy needs the brand needs Um it's at that OK so it's about behavior and it's affecting behavior So there are different ways to do that So in studying that you know there's command and control which is and there's kind of sticks and carrots,0.97,1.0
19,en-US,354.0999936,17.279999999999998,And the more I dug into it as well I was thinking there's another way which is this idea of soft power which really again to go back to the metaphor it's always if you think about power in context and often in,0.98,1.0
20,en-US,371.4899968,17.0599936,You'll hear the expression business is war That's a kind of tricky tricky statement because businesses certainly aren't waging war against each other literally But if you listen to the language Uh you realize you know that it is it's a metaphor,0.98,1.0
21,en-US,388.56,19.5000064,It's a language that that is built on you know deploying strategies and launching you know tactics And consumers are targets that you aim at and hope to hit And I mean even PowerPoint is full of bullets Right So think about that language you know and you think and then you realize you know that it's again this kind,0.99,1.0
22,en-US,408.06000639999996,20.56,of predictability that's very linear kind of Um Um environment And in that context if if the perception of design is one of well you know here I have this battle raging around me competitors and whatnot and you designer who know nothing about my business are what are you going to do,0.99,1.0
23,en-US,428.6400256,21.52,Just kind of make the uniforms prettier you know that kind of idea than what What's the relevance But then when you realize again So in this metaphor We also realize that this even the metaphor of war has changed and Uh we're coming up on the anniversary very soon but 2011 was really a big wake up where we realized,0.97,1.0
24,en-US,450.1600256,22.0799488,that power had nothing to do with scale You know it wasn't about having the biggest army or the most tanks or it was really where you know just you know just a very kind of you know kind of other act Um and kind of actor could really disrupt the whole thing,1.0,1.0
25,en-US,472.6000128,14.719999999999999,Similarly today you've got you know someone who has a bad experience with your brand can with 140 characters you know in a late night rant can also kind of bomb your whole product or service or image if you're a company,0.99,1.0
26,en-US,487.3299968,15.299993599999999,We've seen that happen So it's a very different sense of power So within that this idea of soft power emerges where it's less about command and control and sticks and carrots and it's more about attraction and really values and so on,1.0,1.0
27,en-US,502.6299904,20.6400512,And I started to think about how that could that apply to design and how could you build that out as a framework as a mindset that would affect not only the behavior of designers but also the behavior of perceptions of our colleagues in terms of how they thought of design,0.99,1.0
28,en-US,524.4400128,17.4899712,So it's been an interesting journey Oh for sure Now take me back just a little step here And Uh when you talk about power or I suppose types of power and you mention Um command and control and you mentioned sticks and carrots,0.98,1.0
29,en-US,542.2299648,21.929983999999997,Can you give me kind of some some background to that what those particular types of power themselves are like Yeah well I think Um you know it's the predictability Uh and it comes from you know behaviors and tools and policies that initially come from military or economic kinds of power or you've got what we see it in the world,0.97,1.0
30,en-US,564.1599487999999,19.5300352,today You've got you know do we use coercion You know do we threaten them or do we sanction them or bribe them Right And so and the understanding that Um Leaders have to really critically analyze just what kind of power they're going to use in a given situation,0.99,1.0
31,en-US,584.5300224,18.689945599999998,So Um and it's usually neither one or the other or a combination And again this idea of soft power doesn't replace other kinds of power but it's important complement in addition to just as design doesn't completely replace any other business function in a company,0.99,1.0
32,en-US,603.2300031999999,26.569983999999998,But it really is an essential addition and complement to to all of the the activity But so this idea of being able to really kind of co-opt people or attract them to what you want and have them want what you want is a very powerful position because again kind of separating the difference between power and control,0.99,1.0
33,en-US,629.8300416,21.2699136,So Um so and that also emerged out of this post Um 9/11 kind of world where the theory actually and I can really start geeking out on this way won't pull me back it because it's fascinating Fascinating because I started to learn about it and try to think about it in terms of what could be valuable to design is,0.93,1.0
34,en-US,651.0999552,22.5900544,that Um so this this really interesting professor from Harvard Joseph Nye kind of coined the phrase and then published his book in the in the early 2000s which started to set that up the third way of soft power as a way to really address some of these very complex conflicts in the world Um not just you know by bombing,1.0,1.0
35,en-US,673.6900095999999,23.4899968,and threatening and so on Right So additionally Um I also studied there's actually a book this huge treatise It's called On War written by this Doeth Prussian count in the eighteen hundreds And he he analyzes it still actually used in the military Um and he still and he analyzes conflict from a variety of different areas,0.97,1.0
36,en-US,697.6,21.449984,And Um what I thought was fascinating as I as I kind of dove into that is of course there's the the kind of typical ah what I would know is what I would imagine you know kind of a very material aspects of war which are things like Um you know the materiality of it the physical the planning the control,0.98,1.0
37,en-US,719.049984,14.4000512,the management But there's also a side that's all about and he calls it out as you know emotions and passion and will uncertainty and friction and intuition And I went whoa like you know that's the world of design right,0.99,1.0
38,en-US,733.4799872,19.2,Exactly World of ambiguity of the what if that we live in And so for that to be recognized as a complementary part and equal to the other rational side of a conflict was really fascinating So he had a framework that he called the remarkable Trinity that was like this triangle,0.98,1.0
39,en-US,753.0399744,17.3700096,And he believed that you could or leaders could analyze you know any conflict around these areas that he kind of likened to reason chance and passion And then you could determine what kinds of power So if you add design into that third,0.99,1.0
40,en-US,771.510016,25.3199872,Aspect of the Trinity You know in addition to the sticks and carrots and so on you have an additional way to analyze a power source and a power resource for marketplace battles or you know kind of winning the hearts and minds of consumers and certainly winning the hearts and minds of consumers through attraction rather than you know,1.0,1.0
41,en-US,797.5200255999999,18.5399808,a lot of the carrots are often things you know the buy one get one and so on and those work But after a while people realize that actually they really undermined the value of your brand over time So being able to be drawn to something without having to be bribed to like it it's a very powerful position,0.98,1.0
42,en-US,816.0600063999999,22.8599808,And we see companies that are employing soft power you know not the big guns of advertising necessarily but or or but certainly there's a soft power aspect and it's very very compelling So certainly Apple is called out where you know that I mean yes they advertise but not as others do,0.99,1.0
43,en-US,838.9199871999999,14.9100544,But their key component is this attraction this pull you know that it is kind of drawing people to what they're doing because we feel a sense of shared value of shared kind of Um belief and shared you know desire,0.98,1.0
44,en-US,853.8599935999999,14.5499648,Right And they understand that And that's a very powerful source there Similarly you know some other good examples are even I think of Um method remember method So it's a classic example as well Right Think about that It's always puzzled me,0.98,1.0
45,en-US,868.4099583999999,18.0900864,So here you've got these two entrepreneurs right And really brilliant guys And they decide to launch a business And what category do they go after But dish soap you know which is you know dominated by these huge kind of multinationals,0.99,1.0
46,en-US,886.5000448,27.359948799999998,Right Pache and Unilever and so on And they chose that category And how do they do it They don't compete power to power They competed by you know by understanding what they're what their essence was And literally you know engaging Karim Rashid like an amazing designer to disrupt the category by creating this beautiful vessel this beautiful bottle,0.96,1.0
47,en-US,914.1599232,18.7401216,for their product that completely disrupted the category Based on the insight that you know this this object could be just as much of an object of desire as the rest of your environment you know and pleasure in terms of your day to day experience,1.0,1.0
48,en-US,932.9099775999999,17.8199552,And you didn't have to hide it you know under the counter when someone came over to visit or something And that you know so their investment early on and part of their startup was an investment in design that literally powerfully changed the category,0.98,1.0
49,en-US,950.7600384,17.0399744,So now if you walk down the aisle literally every you know company has done their equivalent of their quote designed bottle because it really became you know they reframed the whole category in the whole experience for people And that's a very powerful example,0.98,1.0
50,en-US,968.3999743999999,23.030067199999998,So that is a great example And you know as you're explaining it it's becoming more and more clear to me this this idea of of soft power And you said something so poignant Uh in regards to method is they didn't match power to power because that wouldn't have worked for them,0.99,1.0
51,en-US,991.4399744,19.970048,There was no way they could be that type of powerful So they found another version of power and used that and like you said to completely disrupt a an industry that is you know arguably been around forever Right,0.99,1.0
52,en-US,1011.4100224,20.559974399999998,Right Right And equally you know for me so in my my role so and you know me So I'm a pretty small kind of woman You know I've kind of had my dance background But coming into these corporate situations where you know I realized OK if I'm if my charge is to really make sure that design is,0.98,1.0
53,en-US,1031.9699968,30.6899968,successful in this company in this category whatever that's a lot of responsibility And that's a powerful role I'm responsible for a lot So I realized I couldn't really because it not just of my my height and so on my stature but I can compete with some big you know towering kind of executive Um physical stature or so on,0.99,1.0
54,en-US,1062.6700288,16.9499648,So I had to find a way it was a good command the room with this booming voice I had to find another way to be powerful in order to not just from Itself but to really be successful on behalf of design which I just so believe in,0.96,1.0
55,en-US,1079.8600192,16.499916799999998,And I always felt like you know it would be malpractise you know if I'm unsuccessful because of my own personal limitations and that I'm unable to you know help advance the cause or design that's so desperately needed in in the situations that I was in,0.98,1.0
56,en-US,1096.6299648,14.099967999999999,So I had to find another way to be powerful And because I wasn't going to be the loudest voice in the room or the tallest person or the biggest whatever or so that was a really important Um learning and strategy,1.0,1.0
57,en-US,1110.7299328,18.420121599999998,I had to find a way And so again soft power because size doesn't matter In fact again you know back to Um 9/11 I mean size didn't matter in that case Sure And yet it completely impacted and affected and changed an outcome which is what we want,0.98,1.0
58,en-US,1129.1500544,21.5498752,You know we want desire to change the outcome That's crazy and you know that's one of the things that fascinates me about you and attracted me to you when we first met years and years and years ago Um And you do have a really Uh soft manner about you,0.98,1.0
59,en-US,1150.72,25.349939199999998,And yet you're still able to be so very effective in these very large brands these very global brands And you know even back in the days when you were in the agency world you know I'm curious just you know as we're kind of circling around this top topic of Uh soft power Um you mentioned that you had a background,0.99,1.0
60,en-US,1176.0699392,13.050060799999999,as a dancer Yes Yeah OK so talk to me just a little bit about that because that just again you know speaks to who you are as an individual and how you how'd you go from there to the world of design,0.99,1.0
61,en-US,1189.6300543999998,18.3000064,Yeah So dance I mean it was so important to me because I started out as a very shy little girl So it was my communication tool if you will you know my way to kind of express and and involve and engage myself in the world,0.99,1.0
62,en-US,1207.9300607999999,13.470003199999999,And when I think about it you know first I thought you know what's that What like the gap between dance and design is That's a pretty big gap But in it but it isn't really because it really is about you know it's about communication it's about storytelling,0.96,1.0
63,en-US,1221.6999936,19.1100928,It's about you know composition and structure and sequence and so on And all of the things especially as design as we've kind of Um seen it dimensionless you know and not just a kind of static print or whatever and kind of experiential all of the kind of way it's amplified,0.98,1.0
64,en-US,1241.0500095999998,21.539942399999997,You really understand that there's a choreography to a designed experience and the ability to kind of really have a kinesthetic experience with design which even if it's on screen or certainly tangible things objects and experiences that people pick up or walk through and Uh are really important but it has that kind of impact,0.98,1.0
65,en-US,1263.1000064,25.560064,And Um so it's very much it's very similar And it was a very important part of my my learning and Uh who I am And Uh so I value it greatly Now that's great And I think that those those back stories of of where we found our passions and how we found our way to where we are today speaks so,0.97,1.0
66,en-US,1289.0500095999998,26.579967999999997,much in filling in the gaps and you know making this story complete So I so appreciate your willingness to to share that Uh And it also speaks again just to Uh the manner in which you approach your work You know with Uh I mean frankly I just have to say it straight out with just an eloquence you know Um a cadence,0.99,1.0
67,en-US,1316.649984,21.6699904,Um You know the choreograph I love the analogy the metaphor there between you know when you look at an entire process of design from you know inception ideation all the way through to completion execution Uh it is choreographed And Uh yet through that that that choreography there has to be flexibility,0.99,1.0
68,en-US,1338.3399424,17.7900544,So it's I love the parallel and choreography It comes through discovery you know and it comes from really understanding your body and the physicality of it So again in terms of relation to consumer experience and desires and needs you're not,0.99,1.0
69,en-US,1357.8399743999998,21.2400128,From a distance you're really engaged and I think that's such a critical part of effective design is really grounding oneself in in that kind of empathy and and discovering the the needs the wants the ambitions the desires you know whether they're they're kind of mundane or whether they're more aspirational,0.99,1.0
70,en-US,1379.0799872,16.650035199999998,And it's a really important part And then I think it's a way of working too So again Um you know I in order to be effective in the roles that I've had part of it as being again is using this idea that I began to then have a way to think about even if it was just for me,0.98,1.0
71,en-US,1395.7300223999998,27.260006399999998,in terms of this soft power framework that could attract people to the work that that my team and I were doing So that Um by using the principles of design you know empathy and ideation and iteration and kind of being able to tolerate risk and ambiguity and also the power of visualization because design really makes strategy possible,0.99,1.0
72,en-US,1422.9999616,22.5800192,And the ability to kind of take Um whether it's just a diagram or a more formalized kind of image or a 3D prototype and be able to use that Um in conversation as a starting point for engagement to kind of pull people in to a what if to a thinking possibility is very very powerful,0.98,1.0
73,en-US,1445.5900159999999,27.239936,You know and so and obviously the idea that which is typically usually the case that those projects and people that did work with my team and I those outcomes were better they were more effective they were more the process was more you know it was itself a kind of different and Um improvement or something that people wanted to,1.0,1.0
74,en-US,1472.8299519999998,22.889984,do again and do more of And so I think that's a very powerful way to start to build momentum and credibility and validation And again you know when you think about because many of the companies I've been in they've been iconic iconic companies and brands and Um and they and virtually every company today is undergoing so much transition,1.0,1.0
75,en-US,1495.7299712,17.9300352,And you know in terms of the way the evolution of the market of consumer demand and desire So being in the midst of that and realizing that it is indeed you know this very Booko world which is you know that military expression of you know volatile uncertain and complex and ambiguous,0.96,1.0
76,en-US,1514.1999615999998,17.040076799999998,And again so how does design fit in that world And it fits in perfectly as soft power because that is the kind of approach that allows you to ideate and iterate and kind of come at it from a place that's less linear and less predictable predictive than the past,0.99,1.0
77,en-US,1531.6600832,24.4799488,And Um again I was shocked to learn you know that was about I think about 10 years ago the military actually brought in design thinking into its Um Uh really officers Uh training program Yes Because why Well because they appreciated not to kind of again make their uniforms Uh better but to but to realize that the world was so much more complex,0.96,1.0
78,en-US,1556.140032,25.410048,and for them and for their officers and then their their squadrons and everyone to be more effective in this crazy world Um they needed a different way to think and plan and build scenarios than the very predictable kind of playbook method that that they were used to which is again this more kind of command kind of linear approach,0.99,1.0
79,en-US,1581.8800128,23.1899136,So again I mean that's just an amazing testament to Um the third way Um and the power that isn't necessarily you know a recognized Um power because when you think about some of the conflicts today and oh my God you know soft power sounds very weak in the in the midst of that but it's actually behind the scenes effecting a,0.97,1.0
80,en-US,1605.0699264,22.710067199999997,lot of what people are trying to achieve And certainly our enemies are very much using it So if you want to analyze those cases it's very obvious how they're using you know how they're shaping perceptions actually using you know design principles in many ways through media and whatnot to to Um recruit and and whatnot,0.99,1.0
81,en-US,1627.7799936,25.449984,It's very Um interesting to watch Wow Now I'm not sure if you said this at the beginning of our conversation Um Truthfully I'm so enamored in listening to what you're talking about that I'm like wait charities maybe not But my my question is what what caused you to want to start studying this,0.98,1.0
82,en-US,1653.2500479999999,15.4300416,I mean what took you down this path of really I mean you're talking About stuff most people in design field in particular wouldn't study you know you're using words like war and Yeah and power away What made you want to do that,0.98,1.0
83,en-US,1668.7099904,17.4000128,Yeah So again so it's trying How could I understand to be more effective myself But also there was it the context was the the the environment So part of that was you know the element of again some of the initial piece was also a presentation,0.98,1.0
84,en-US,1686.4100351999998,12.520038399999999,And I don't remember if it was an age conference or maybe Few's or Power Conference where that first step was I was going to tackle I said OK I'm going to tackle this seat at the table Like what is that about,0.94,1.0
85,en-US,1698.9499392,20.310015999999997,OK That's right And then as part of that you know learning about that Um the sequence of that Let me go deeper So then the next presentation I did was really about breaking down the silos So that was OK as I was understanding more about the business mind which is you know the mind of what is and again,0.99,1.0
86,en-US,1719.2599552,19.709951999999998,this kind of predictability and even the way their their education path and so on and and just this whole kind of Um context for the business mind versus the design mind Um and design education And so how we were actually kind of we were trained differently,0.98,1.0
87,en-US,1738.9799424,10.6901504,Right And so the language we use and so on really understanding that And then OK well then how do you resolve that And then that became so it's just cumulative learning that kind of pulled it into the soft power thing,0.97,1.0
88,en-US,1749.680128,13.199974399999999,Got it Um Because if you circle back to the metaphor the very first presentation was about this metaphor a seat at the table So what is seat at the table So a seat at the table comes from King Arthur,0.93,1.0
89,en-US,1762.9100032,18.1798912,Right So King Arthur who Um I discovered I didn't know this about him but is the Um the best the designer of the best order of knights in the world Right So I think OK designer that sort of night I didn't realize that was he was a designer,0.94,1.0
90,en-US,1781.0898943999998,14.940159999999999,But you think about so and you think about his time So in King Arthur's Day the Middle Ages it was also a very buka time if you will was really there were the wars and plagues and barbarians and all sorts of things,0.96,1.0
91,en-US,1796.0300544,20.3700224,And their sense of power was things were just taken by force and king lords and those people had power and no one else had power So an individual had no set right Or a sense of power So King Arthur if you think about him and you think about his knights in his kind of all of his type,0.98,1.0
92,en-US,1816.4000767999999,20.009984,a high you know his his elite team coming together for their their annual or their monthly or whatever kind of conventions and kind of discussions and all jockeying for power being close to him and so on And so what did he do in terms of being able to kind of have an effective team,1.0,1.0
93,en-US,1837.2499455999998,20.400128,He redesigned the table right from this kind of long table to the Valder circular table So that was a design decision Now what did that do So that decision distributed the power So he was still the king but it gave it allowed everyone seated at that table to have a sense of contribution,0.97,1.0
94,en-US,1857.6799744,13.6200192,In fact they were expected to contribute and it allowed him to use his power i.e. the individuals and collectively his group of knights And that also became because at the time there were values and beliefs of chivalry and so on that,0.99,1.0
95,en-US,1871.2999935999999,12.0000512,So it was linked to also values that were emerging at the time So that's design decision You know that's a power of you kind of reshape the perceptions you kind of drawing people to a different thing not command and control,0.97,1.0
96,en-US,1883.6000768,23.2198144,So that was the metaphor So I think well what's the metaphor is poor design you know and that's kind of led me to this idea of soft power that So that's part of the journey for us Yeah well I mean it's it's crazy that you're you're able to relate this this idea of soft power this idea of,0.95,1.0
97,en-US,1907.5999743999998,20.819968,Um what design is to these historical events these historical characters You know so King Arthur all the way to 9/11 Um this is what I love about you Moira is this this ability to make those connections Um with seemingly unconnected aspects,0.99,1.0
98,en-US,1929.1500543999998,18.620006399999998,Well it helps you know it helps validate design right To those skeptics that it's not that it is powerful you know that it has existed that it's a force of power in the world to be utilized and resourced as one of your choices or combined with other things,0.99,1.0
99,en-US,1948.2499071999998,22.8501504,As you analyze the different situations that you're in as a brand as a company as an individual you know so Um Yeah so I think again is trying to really find another way to validate what it is that all of us who are designers and really understand this power how to really allow it to really be fully fully,0.99,1.0
100,en-US,1971.1000576,19.739852799999998,utilized and realized in the world Absolutely And you know one of the the definitions that I love to use when talking to skeptics or it's not even skeptics Yes there's a there's a world of skeptics out there when it comes to design,0.98,1.0
101,en-US,1990.8399104,12.9900544,But there's there's also people that just misunderstand what design really is They you know of course go to that Oh well it's a logo right It's like oh God Really Are we still there No that's not what it is,0.97,1.0
102,en-US,2004.3399167999999,23.7901824,It's not pictures and colors and stuff like that But for me the definition that I always have used in explaining it is that it's it's the act of being purposeful in the act of being deliberate Um choosing to do something in a particular fashion because you desire a certain result,1.0,1.0
103,en-US,2028.460032,27.2699392,And that's where with what you're saying with you know King Arthur and the roundtable and the idea of there there was obviously a result that he wanted And in order to have that result happen he had to redefine Uh relook at what was being done in the current state of things and refashion it Uh redesign it to get that,0.98,1.0
104,en-US,2055.7299712,18.2398976,effect And that was very much on purpose It was not an accident And I'm not I'm not saying that there isn't you know ideation and trial and error and you know Um prototyping to get to that point But Uh even those things are a purposeful part of the journey of discovery,1.0,1.0
105,en-US,2074.149888,25.320038399999998,Right Because it it's it's actualizing It's making visible your strategic intent Right And so and it's very powerful Um And yeah all of the rest of that part can be invisible to people Just the outcome is something maybe But the but the all of the the part of that process that actually that does start with thinking Um a way,0.99,1.0
106,en-US,2099.4699264,25.140224,of thinking a way of approaching the world that is shared It can be shared not just by designers Right So you can have a design mind and and design centric kind of process that doesn't that is not excluded to just exclusive to designers but actuating be you know be the kind of key Uh and visualize the key parts,0.97,1.0
107,en-US,2124.6101504,21.569740799999998,of that There are designers that need to actually do that They're people that are highly trained But you can create an environment that is more receptive to that because it is both critical and creative thinking Um And that ability you know for designers to visualize Um kind of early parts of that is really invaluable in terms of helping people,0.99,1.0
108,en-US,2146.4199168,18.5401344,even clarify their strategy Right because Um the strategy is the context for the outcome And if you it's like the classic case Well you know if you have a design brief and there's a stated goal and you know so here we're going to evaluate as you said this logo based on that,0.99,1.0
109,en-US,2164.9600511999997,12.069887999999999,Well I don't like the logo Well if the logo meets the criteria of the brief which is linked to the strategy then we might need to reevaluate strategy because if this is a bit different there may be a different logo,0.98,1.0
110,en-US,2177.0500096,24.0001024,Right So I think it's really helping people understand Um that mindset and the thinking process which is again it's a very different process for Most business minds that have been kind of trained and just tend to favor a different kind of thinking and God bless them I'm so glad they do because that's not my preferred style,0.99,1.0
111,en-US,2201.050112,19.5600384,And we need people to think about the things that they do but they need people like us to think about the things that we do because especially in today's world where these are not predictable problems and we you know there's no playbook for a kind of predictable solution,1.0,1.0
112,en-US,2222.0500991999997,12.329779199999999,You're so right there Uh And it is both sides of that that we that we need And I like being the type of thinker that I am but I certainly do appreciate the type of thinker that someone else is,0.99,1.0
113,en-US,2234.3798784,18.590105599999998,And I feel that when those two things are brought together we we truly have our highest levels of you know productivity and effectiveness Uh Beyond a shadow of a doubt Yeah And I think we're kind of mutually indispensable And it's getting business to a really appreciate that we are mutually indispensable at this point,0.98,1.0
114,en-US,2252.9800192,20.640153599999998,You know and that's that's a good thing for sure It's absolutely the truth Now one last little thing I'd love to ask you about Um as you kind of went through this discovery Um of soft power and really how powerful it is in and of itself,1.0,1.0
115,en-US,2273.8898944,24.7400448,Can you think of a specific Um time in your career Uh you know since this this discovery has been taking place where you really were able to go Yeah that's what I mean by soft power This is something that I'm able to now utilize and understand in order to be a better leader a better designer,1.0,1.0
116,en-US,2298.6399744,17.2599296,Was there a particular time where that stood out to you Well let's see there I can think of two quick examples that kind of both were when I was at Coca-Cola So that was kind of in you know 2005 2008 between those times,0.97,1.0
117,en-US,2316.2800128,17.189888,And Um so we were working on the new visual identity at the time which went on to win the award at Cannes and was just an amazing project But very early days And again I mean everyone sees the outcome which was lauded and theme,0.99,1.0
118,en-US,2333.4699008,16.9199616,So but of course you know really solution But Um as designers can imagine the inside being in the trenches of fighting the fights and kind of building the momentum and credibility for that to keep it moving along was really important,0.99,1.0
119,en-US,2350.4199679999997,23.1901184,So there was one point and advice involves kind of research right That kind of being of design And so the research came back This was on the Um the red can Uh We had kind of removed all of the extra fake dripping water and ice you know from the outside of the can because the reel and the packaging because,0.97,1.0
120,en-US,2373.6100864,22.139903999999998,the the essence of the brand and our strategic intent was really about authenticity and about simplicity and the purity of the classic kind of Um So that was all extraneous But in the category those are really important cues because those in the business were convinced that they had to be there to attract consumers and make them buy a,0.99,1.0
121,en-US,2395.7499904,19.260006399999998,product So Um that's when the results came back from this clean or can the pure brilliant red and just the simple white Um ribbon and the enlarge Coca-Cola logo the one of the key Um Um part of the brand they mentioned was happiness,0.91,1.0
122,en-US,2415.0401024,17.999872,So this idea of happiness inside So again you know I'd promoted that design you know made you know strategy visible Part of the strategy was this idea of happiness So I was confronted by senior leadership and said literally OK Moira how happy is that Ken,0.97,1.0
123,en-US,2433.8200576,19.800064,Right No Right And so the the numbers in the testing were not good It wasn't showing that it was the happy can according to the numbers So I thought oh my God like if the price goes down because of that I because I was so convinced you know we were working with turnour Duclair so convinced that this,0.96,1.0
124,en-US,2453.9799552,15.480012799999999,this was the right thing to do based on where we wanted to move the brand and so on We could not fail So over the weekend I got all of the research Um results including the anecdotal comments from the participants,1.0,1.0
125,en-US,2470.0000256,18.1798912,And Um this is very common now But it was actually a kind of newer Um kind of method at the time Um which is a word cloud Right So I literally as I was reading through all of these comments I thought yes you know people,1.0,1.0
126,en-US,2488.2900992,14.790041599999999,Really are responding to this So we did a word cloud of the anecdotal comment so again these are the words of consumers or participants not the marketing words that we put on a list that they chose but their words,0.99,1.0
127,en-US,2503.4098688,25.500057599999998,And in the word cloud what emerged was a picture a story if you will contrasting the current and the proposed design And you could see that indeed the new design was quote happier It might not have literally been the word happy over and over but it was it was exactly that sentiment and exactly that emotional kind of,0.99,1.0
128,en-US,2528.9099263999997,15.450111999999999,resonance that people were feeling So that was like whoa So I used that That was my argument and that was the way I was able to come back and kind of present and influence the positive effect of this work,0.99,1.0
129,en-US,2544.3600383999997,16.9500672,And the other piece was Um with with the Um the aluminum bottle Right The beautiful contour bottle Right And so R&D had come up with the shape It was amazing It was beautiful It was very expensive Um There was no real plan,0.98,1.0
130,en-US,2561.3101056,14.759936,What could they do with it at the moment So Ted Turner Duckworth apply the strategy this kind of trademark strategy of red black silver the big and large trademark around the belly of the bottle to these three shapes,0.99,1.0
131,en-US,2576.8501248,20.369817599999998,And all I had was a printout on eight and a half by 11 white paper three bottles red black silver lined up in a thing And I would carry this paper I would have it in my notebook And inevitably probably at least once a day or so at least several times a week I would have an opportunity,0.97,1.0
132,en-US,2597.2199424,19.919871999999998,every chance I took to pull that out in conversation as a way to to help people see another way that the brand could be perceived Right Because we were building an arc from the classic legacy to a brand that could evolve and be literally 21st century refreshment,0.99,1.0
133,en-US,2617.7400832,14.870118399999999,So kind of shaping that possibility shaping those perceptions Over and over and kind of getting people attracted to that possibility not forcing them OK we got to do this Boom boom boom Yes we really needed to do it,0.99,1.0
134,en-US,2632.909824,19.380224,But there was another way you know and again this doesn't all sound really soft and namby pamby There's a strength in the way that this this can be presented and you can set up your your you know powers in terms of really influencing again to affect behavior of others to get the outcome that you want,0.98,1.0
135,en-US,2652.290048,21.1800064,And ultimately it was successful And Um now I see the bottles in Penn Station after many years of course and they built that scale But Uh but that was an amazing example for me too of an ability to again reframe and shape the perception without Um because I wasn't going to be able to kind of command the men to do,0.95,1.0
136,en-US,2673.4798848,23.0301696,it But we got them to do you know we got the outcome that we wanted That's great You know I love that you used the word strength Uh because power and strength I don't think are are synonymous with each other necessarily especially not in the context of what you and I are talking about today Uh because you know strength,0.99,1.0
137,en-US,2696.5100543999997,23.089971199999997,is that thing that you rely on It's it's something that holds you up Right And yet it's not necessarily power So regardless of whether the the the power that you're using is soft power or if it's more that commanding there's still strength inside of quietness,0.99,1.0
138,en-US,2719.6100607999997,21.6600576,There's strength inside of softness And sometimes it's stronger than using the more commanding barbaric methodologies of of power Um So I love that you you actually said the word strength Hmm Yeah Because yeah you could make a big difference in the world without without yelling and still be strong,0.99,1.0
139,en-US,2742.0200959999997,16.6498304,Right That's exactly exactly the case And and Moyra you have done that And I am so appreciative of you taking the time to Um share some of the conversations that you and I have been having with Uh the podcast listeners out there,0.99,1.0
