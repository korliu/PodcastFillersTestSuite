83,en-US,1449.28,20.819968,And I will go I leave the office Um I go upstairs I normally have an iPad waiting for me upstairs And I read a comic book on the iPad Uh because you know it's a very different type of Uh storytelling And it usually most comics will take about 10 or 15 minutes to read and then you know grab a cup,0.98,1.0
84,en-US,1470.099968,16.3800064,of tea or go back to it And I just do that Pomodoro thing again And that's four hours work normally completed by about one one thirty And usually to be honest most writers are done after four hours We're pretty lazy and Um weak,0.94,1.0
85,en-US,1486.6299904,12.479999999999999,And you know we can't work much longer than that So it's over like that's the day done And Um I will in the afternoon you know I'm might sort of you know do something on my blog but I'll often read that's what I'll get my reading done,0.96,1.0
86,en-US,1500.4599296,10.1100544,Um If I have Uh like a newspaper column or something I still have to write I might do it in the afternoon And then of course I've got the kids to pick up from about three three thirty and Um then hours of wrangling them,0.97,1.0
87,en-US,1510.569984,21.240115199999998,So so that is that is my workday Um And that's pretty much every day day in day out And it's very Um it's very unglamorous and unromantic But the thing is if you do that if you just commit to turning up every day whether you feel like it or not and doing the work you will even if you're not,0.99,1.0

90,en-US,1559.6199935999998,16.1700864,Well partly partly because I feel a lot of sympathy for him because he started writing this a long time ago And when it was first published it did not work like it came out in the US in the UK Uh and it was very poorly handled by the publishers,0.99,1.0
91,en-US,1575.79008,11.6099072,They had terrible covers on it And it was actually his Australian publisher who saved the series by someone You know it just it came out as some package of a bunch of titles that they picked up from head office,0.98,1.0
92,en-US,1587.9100415999999,12.7199232,And someone I didn't know who the publisher is here Um but they someone in the office picked it up read it The parts is awesome you know Look at this Richard sinkhole of a cover And we could have we can do better on this,0.94,1.0
93,en-US,1601.3800448,22.4699392,And Um so the Australian publisher designed a new cover And it it just Uh in a weird way that these things do It suddenly just lit a fire under this thing and then that spread back to Um the US and the UK in the way that it will say that he he was writing this series for a long time obviously,0.97,1.0
94,en-US,1623.849984,16.469913599999998,before Uh HBO got involved and it was getting bigger and bigger but it was getting bigger in a you know the way the books get bigger like you can be someone who sells six million copies of a book and you can walk down the street in Manhattan and you know go,0.97,1.0

96,en-US,1653.5699456,16.8900608,You know there's a lot of a lot of hysteria and chaos that gets introduced into your life when you send those levels of mass cultural awareness And it will be very very difficult for him to just sit down every day and do the work,1.0,1.0
97,en-US,1670.6999296,18.3799808,And so I suspect that you know he just had just the storm of distraction and disruption fall on him a couple of years ago And of course as the deadline gets closer and closer to that sort of existential soul leading panic begins to sink its teeth deeper into you,0.98,1.0
98,en-US,1689.0899456,11.8800384,And eventually he just had to put out you know the statement he put out last year So I can't do it Everyone was thinking you know the TV series caught up with him What happens now And he just had to admit he couldn't catch it,0.96,1.0
99,en-US,1700.9800192,18.5299968,I'm not watching the TV series really because we lost our watched up until now being away But I want to read the books first Um and some I assume But I think I'm guessing that the books will diverge from the TV series because you know they are separate media,0.89,1.0
100,en-US,1719.5999232,15.8101504,You can't help but wonder like because we know that he's given the people who make the show have an outline Yeah So endgame is you know there are certain characters who live and who die in one form of the story who might only die in the other form,0.91,1.0
101,en-US,1735.4201088,12.849971199999999,So I want to read the book and then I'll Um Uh think I want to But the other thing is too I don't have a foxtail subscription and I am just Uh kind of easy to avoid them Yeah well I'm just on red hot,0.93,1.0

103,en-US,1764.009984,16.7901184,I do wonder Um because I I read the books a little while ago Um before the show started which I know is a thing people say But like I I read them around about the time that Um a feast for Christmas a friend of mine was reading it and recommended the series,0.96,1.0
104,en-US,1780.8001024,20.9999872,And so I had all of these books And then there was a long way the Um dance with dragons And then we had the TV show And now I'm like I'm watching the new series but I can't I can't Um help but wonder when the show comes before the books what's going to be considered canon now by most people,0.97,1.0
105,en-US,1802.5199616,13.350092799999999,Well most people will watch the show like you know I mean the the books sell lots and lots and lots of copies but they don't match the ratings for the show as far as I know Like probably more people steal the show in Australia than have ever bought the books,0.99,1.0
106,en-US,1818.840064,19.9798784,Uh Uh And that's and that's a byproduct of writer's block book But I didn't hear your book Yeah So it's like writer's block As I said it's it does exist And the reason I brought George up was that you know he admitted to having it but a lot of time write his book is actually not writer's block,0.91,1.0
107,en-US,1838.850048,15.960064,It's you know boredom or disinterest or distraction Um And you know there were various ways of dealing with it Um I had a problem in my last series the day of the series I was writing I was writing from one point of view Dave I'd never done that before in a series,0.96,1.0
108,en-US,1854.810112,14.699929599999999,I'd always written from multiple points of view And I found that I could not Um I could not understand what the other characters around him were thinking I couldn't predict what they were going to do I didn't understand their motivation,0.99,1.0
109,en-US,1870.08,8.5198848,And it got to a point was actually very difficult to to move forward in the story because I didn't know what the other people on the page were up to simply because I wasn't writing from within the point of view,0.96,1.0
110,en-US,1879.1999488,20.460134399999998,And Um it brought me to a halt for about a week or so And that wasn't writer's block That was an inability to imagine what was going on with you know the other people on the page And the way I dealt with it eventually was to write a couple of chapters from their point of view that were never,1.0,1.0
111,en-US,1899.6600832,23.6099584,going to be published Um But it helped me understand what those characters were about And actually in the end Um they did get published because I just published them as standalone books Uh And it's kind of interesting Like they you there was there's a book called The Prodigal Sorry in e-book called The Protocol for Monsters which effectively tells retells the,0.98,1.0
112,en-US,1923.2700416,16.4100096,story of emergence But from the point of view of everybody around Dave and you get a very very different story And that all grew out of not writer's block but an inability to imagine what these characters might do because I didn't understand them,0.98,1.0
113,en-US,1939.9798784,17.8599936,And There are all sorts of instances where people have trouble putting words on the page that are technical fouls or blockages like that but not actual writer's block which I think is a form of depression and a sickness of the soul,0.99,1.0
