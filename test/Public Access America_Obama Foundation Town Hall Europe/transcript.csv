82,en-US,1832.8600576,13.949952,Um My name is on the order I'm from Latvia and I'm a journalist But in Washington D.C. I was advocating for Baltic states in the US Congress So explaining to us congressmen the issues that are important for us in Estonia Latvia and Lithuania,0.98,1.0
83,en-US,1847.2599552,18.2099968,And my question is that these days I think a lot of international agreements are being broken And sometimes international alliances are being talked about in the light way Uh But for us in such small countries it's so important to be part of secure and strong long term alliances,0.99,1.0
84,en-US,1865.8299903999998,20.1900032,So my question would be what the leaders of Estonia Latvia and Lithuania could do how in a better way we can communicate to make sure that Um everyone understands the importance of these alliances And also Uh this might be a bit silly but Uh could you sign this piece of paper with your famous phrase are you fired up,0.99,1.0
85,en-US,1886.0500992,30.4799744,Are you ready to go I can I'll do that afterwards Okay Thank you so much Um It You know after World War Two And the tragedy that engulfed Europe and then engulfed the world We set up a set of international institutions the U.N. you know Bretton Woods World Bank et cetera,0.98,1.0
86,en-US,1917.5499776,18.8899328,And the idea was I think a recognition that you had to have some sort of international order To try to mitigate against a repeat of those tragedies and you had Naito and others alliances that were established in part because of the emerging Cold War,0.99,1.0
87,en-US,1938.2800384,28.6799872,Those institutions were in perfect Oftentimes the participants including my own country operated hypocritically within Those institutions and the declarations and charters were often violated or ignored But they did create a structure and a set of aspirations so that small countries defenseless peoples,0.97,1.0
88,en-US,1969.1300864,17.569792,Vulnerable groups could appeal to the ideal and the principle and take that charter or piece of paper and say look this is what you said And that gave Uh Some leverage some some Uh force to the argument that over time,0.99,1.0
89,en-US,1987.8299648,15.9399936,Improved The situation and then obviously with the fall of the wall and the the end of the Cold War you then saw this blossoming of of excitement and opportunity Uh Now we're really going to live up to all these ideals,1.0,1.0
90,en-US,2003.7699584,17.1700224,And as I said before we unfortunately I think standard crossroads now a time where we took for granted some of that progress Didn't tend to our democracies and our alliances and our international institutions as well as we should have,1.0,1.0
91,en-US,2022.230016,34.8000256,Didn't update them and adapt them to new circumstances And As people started feeling insecure or frustrated because of Economic changes technological changes demographic changes we got This Backlash and reaction to that order So our challenge now is how do we refresh and renew these ideas with respect to the alliances that the Baltics are part of I'm assuming,1.0,1.0
92,en-US,2057.0300416,16.2799616,you're referring to for example Naito As president I was very clear that there were no junior or senior members of Naito and that Article four in Article five means what it says and that it has to be Not just,0.97,1.0
93,en-US,2075.9699456,26.2098944,Talked about with nice phrases but there have to be planning and work done to Prepare for the possibility of mutual self or mutual defense And so we implemented a whole range of exercises and Planning Uh to reflect that I can't say exactly what the United States and Naito is doing right now,0.98,1.0
94,en-US,2102.17984,22.880256,I recognize that there are some strains I think that the most important thing that Countries like Estonia and Latvia you know other Baltics can do Is to continue do reflect internally the values of Democracy freedom rule of law,0.98,1.0
95,en-US,2126.6100223999997,19.3800192,So that when it speaks on the world stage and it speaks in international forums It has credibility And it is able to then say look we are doing what we pledged and promised to do in this charter and in this document,1.0,1.0
96,en-US,2147.0799872,23.040204799999998,And we expect you The larger countries that are signatories to this to do the same Um I think if you I think when there's backsliding internally Then you have less moral force in that argument Um I Uh would also say though that,0.99,1.0
97,en-US,2173.6599552,19.239936,No matter how Much all the countries in Naito or any other alliance believe in that alliance in the abstract It's always better for us not to have to test it And that means for example that the stronger that Europe as a whole is,1.0,1.0
98,en-US,2193.9800064,24.4498432,The more that The work that all of your peers here are doing The more that the European Parliament is reflecting on Uh or is reflective of the values of democracy and rule of law and so forth That inoculates you know it's it it strengthens,0.99,1.0
99,en-US,2219.6299776,21.210112,The European project it strengthens Naito and it serves as a defense A nonmilitary defense but a defense against potential encroachment So so I think it's important not to separate Military alliances this the strength of Europe over the last,0.96,1.0
100,en-US,2242.0299775999997,20.1199616,Twenty thirty years has not been because there were a bunch of missiles fired It was because thankfully It was because ideas won And if we start losing the ideas then We're going to have problems no matter what All right,0.97,1.0

105,en-US,2340.5801472,18.1798912,And the issue that Uh we are facing in Sweden and also of course all over Europe is how do we Um break that segregation How do we break that We undem a narrative that is literally Um holding back Europe and particularly in Sweden's opportunity to to succeed,0.97,1.0
106,en-US,2359.0600704,12.0799232,For example just 10 years from now 30 percent of the Um working age in Sweden will be foreign born I assume that will be the same thing in across Europe So how do we break that to we and them,0.95,1.0
107,en-US,2371.6898816,16.800153599999998,Uh How do you create a new Um Um narrative and you have succeeded that in the U.S. Uh and make another question to you Sorry guys Uh Is that Um how how do you deal with Um being a part of two worlds and always being heckled by both sides Uh when you're trying to build a bridge,0.99,1.0

109,en-US,2425.2499967999997,18.6898432,The first thing I would say is that You probably have some better answers than I do because of the fact That you are working in a specific community with Specific people face to face and so often the way that you arrive at,1.0,1.0
110,en-US,2444.9298432,20.4101632,Ideas of breaking down these barriers is on the ground Human to human as opposed to Abstract ideas so I should be asking you what works and Uh and you should be sharing you and others who are working on these issues should be sharing what seems to work and what doesn't,1.0,1.0
111,en-US,2469.1800064,31.3901056,I'll make some general observations though The first is that It's important for all of us to admit That In every society There is some Temptation tendency to separate people who are more like me and less like me That's not unique to white Europeans,1.0,1.0
112,en-US,2503.000064,26.179788799999997,You know my father's from Kenya You go to Kenya byelaws I think the Kikuyus are always out to get them And the Kikuyus think Uh the laws they talk but they're lazy I'm not going to hire them And you go to the Middle East and you know when everybody gets here suddenly oh you know we're all Arab and,0.97,1.0
113,en-US,2530.12992,27.74016,You go back home Uh Are these people those people right So so one thing to recall is that there is a this is a universal phenomenon because humans are fairly primitive and we're still wired to only be able to process like knowing about 150 people in our brains,0.98,1.0
114,en-US,2558.5000448,18.3898112,And so now suddenly we're we're in cities with strangers that we don't know and we're asked to trust them And it goes against some of our impulses And the reason I say that is because I think if you don't acknowledge that,1.0,1.0
115,en-US,2578.259968,20.8001024,Then Uh There's going to be a certain arrogance in how you approach these problems and the problems won't get solved That's point number one We all have some of these biases inside of us It's not just Yeah those people,0.98,1.0
116,en-US,2600.3798016,28.4401664,Right If we if if we start with that that premise then I think What that means is that We have to find ways to have a humane intelligent Uh Thoughtful orderly immigration process That is grounded in our better selves and our better values,0.99,1.0
117,en-US,2632.489984,18.5300992,And we're going to have to figure out how do we make the people who are already in a country Feel comfortable with newcomers And that requires education and exposure and reducing fear on the part of people who are already there,0.99,1.0
118,en-US,2652.029952,27.219967999999998,It also requires some levels of adaptation from the people who are coming in And I think organizations like yours Can help to identify Those those mechanisms that can help both sides In the United States immigration has always been controversial,1.0,1.0
119,en-US,2680.370176,22.239846399999998,And at some level immigrants Adapted to the norms of the existing society So that if you look at how the Irish for example were talked about in the United States Oh It's as bad as anything you know Irish no Irish no need apply,0.99,1.0
120,en-US,2704.090112,33.639833599999996,There was a time where Uh the Irish and Jews and Um Italians They weren't considered white They were they were considered Aliens foreigners Then they got absorbed now Black folks never got absorbed right that took a little bit longer Um And so some of the assimilate similar Uh assimilation that inevitably takes place is going to take a little bit longer but,0.97,1.0
121,en-US,2738.939904,27.540070399999998,Some of those principles still apply and and I worry sometimes when Uh As we think about how to deal with the immigration issue We think that any Uh moves towards assimilation of the existing Uh of newcomers to the existing culture is somehow a betrayal or a denial of people's heritage or what have you,0.98,1.0
122,en-US,2769.7600512,15.7100032,I mean the truth of the matter is is that if if you're going to have a coherent cohesive society then everybody has to have some agreed upon rules And they're going to have to be some accommodations that everybody makes and that includes the people who are newcomers,0.99,1.0
123,en-US,2785.8898944,17.360076799999998,The question is are those fair Do they You know the you know Should we want to encourage newcomers to learn the language of the country they're moving to Of course Does that mean that they can never use their own language,0.99,1.0
124,en-US,2803.7300224,16.0600064,No of course that doesn't mean that but It's you know it's not racist to say Uh if you're going to be here then you should learn the language of the country that you Just arrived at because we need to have some sort of common language in which all of us,0.99,1.0
125,en-US,2821.5701504,19.7699584,Can work and learn and understand each other It gets more sensitive obviously around religious issues That becomes more challenging and I don't have you know simple solutions to all of that But but I guess what I what I think we have to do in order to push back against just,1.0,1.0
126,en-US,2842.5000959999998,18.0299776,You know Uh what are clearly racist motives of some We can't label everybody who is disturbed by immigration as racist You know that's a self-defeating tactic You push Away potential allies people who maybe they just haven't thought about it,0.99,1.0
127,en-US,2860.7700992,19.8598656,They may be good people who are well meaning they just don't understand and said but if they're exposed to new information and they're meeting people who are from other countries and they understand the nature of these different traditions and they see that others are eager to work with you then suddenly they go oh OK,0.98,1.0
128,en-US,2881.9800064,24.120115199999997,And you know some of the work that Was done in Switzerland and other places where you mobilize people to say look this is not who we are and to appeal to their best natures Shows that The majority of Europeans don't want to think of themselves as mean or ungenerous or racist just like the majority of Americans don't,0.99,1.0
129,en-US,2906.1001216,18.469887999999997,want to think of themselves in that way Um But if If the only Uh thing they're hearing is either people who are making them afraid or people who are saying you're racist Then they don't feel as if they've got room,1.0,1.0
130,en-US,2925.6699903999997,16.2899968,To find their better selves and we have to continually find ways to to speak to them and a lot of that happens face to face which is why organizations like yours ends up being so important You do have to figure out how do you link the work that you're doing on a local level with,1.0,1.0
131,en-US,2943.4699775999998,20.429824,Broader political efforts to push back against discriminatory unjust legislation Um And so the micro has to work with the macro Uh in order to be successful All right Oh Uh Uh you had another question but I don't remember what it was that was such a,0.99,1.0

145,en-US,3242.279936,14.160076799999999,And as a sort of secondary part to that if you feel that there's any Uh space for more mindfulness in politics Uh to be able to lead to more peaceful peaceful politics Well I definitely think that there are some politicians who could use some meditation,0.99,1.0
146,en-US,3257.5399936,27.290009599999998,I there's no doubt about that Um I can think of a few who you know just sit there for a little bit and Reflect Find him find some inner peace Um Now let me broaden the question a little bit I mean I will tell you that that,0.98,1.0
