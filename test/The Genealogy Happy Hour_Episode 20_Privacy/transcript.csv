4,en-US,69.02999679999999,12.42,I haven't been there And it was four days It was gorgeous And but the only thing I thought of walking through this is poor workers that had to decorate this umpteen million trees I probably wouldn't even want to go home and decorate my own after that,0.95,1.0
5,en-US,81.8700032,19.259993599999998,But they were gorgeous And of course the highlight to any trip to the Biltmore is hitting the winery and Um and getting their Christmas blend So I picked up Um a couple of bottles probably more than a couple bottles of the Christmas red and the Christmas white which are both so delicious,0.99,1.0
6,en-US,101.1299968,21.940006399999998,And the red is a soft red with fruit and berries and spice and the white is a semisweet Um with apricot and spice and citrus flavors And we're sampling the Christmas red today And it's delicious Delicious And the label is gorgeous,0.99,1.0

10,en-US,164.31000319999998,12.299993599999999,Yes I like I like that one OK well I put up the one with the Um the one I got had Ben Franklin on the front I think it was a cab Um So I put that one up there too because that was I think I've had their Chardonnay,0.97,1.0
11,en-US,176.6700032,10.36,OK Yeah I like it You know I'm not a red fan So I just I mean it was OK for me Yeah but Um maybe the way it would be better But I was just super excited to see that Uh while I was reading that book,0.96,1.0
12,en-US,187.0899968,14.6,I'm not sure Yeah of course I have to drink that while I'm reading about Alexander And I think about that because I was driving I was listening to the British driving that drinking driving me That's why I knew there was a reason,0.9,1.0
13,en-US,203.10000639999998,14.9099776,OK so let's get to the book review book So the book we're reviewing today is The Spyglass File by Nathan Dillon Goodwin who is one of our favorites I think we've read all of his book work at this point,0.96,1.0
14,en-US,218.2200064,18.809984,We are fans and this is a Morton Barrere forensic genealogy genealogists story And Uh the latest Uh in the run is you can totally read it on your own But if you know if you've read the previous ones you can follow Mortons personal journey,0.95,1.0
15,en-US,237.7499904,20.110003199999998,Um But the story in this is a standalone story And so interesting Um I loved this time period the World War two Um time period and had no idea of the job that ah Uh one of the women Uh in the story has,0.98,1.0
16,en-US,257.8800128,15.7799936,I thought that was it really does highlight Uh women's roles in in the war especially Um British women in the war and Um the fact that they were stationed in in Malta you know during Uh Yeah You know the battles there And so yeah it was great,0.95,1.0
17,en-US,273.670016,17.209984,Yeah So Um he's had I guess Martin Farrior or genealogist in the story is having Uh the hero time He's having a tough time in his is his career I guess And Um he's also in the midst of searching for his father who his who his real father is,0.93,1.0
18,en-US,292.64998399999996,14.4600064,Um So he's he's gotten the case here from a woman who's trying to find out about her parents She had I think she had recently found out that she was she was looking for her birth record and she couldn't find it,0.99,1.0
19,en-US,307.10999039999996,22.8400128,And it kind of freaked her out a little bit And the more she delved into it she realized she found it And it was a she had different parents Yes So she's hooked up with the with Her Uh step siblings and Um has started Uh and has asked Morton to help her find her parents or find out the mystery of,0.97,1.0
20,en-US,329.95000319999997,19.079987199999998,her birth And he and his delving into the story We go back in time Um to World War Two a little cottage which has some serious mysteries about it that she stayed and Um that her mother stayed at the woman's mother stayed at,0.98,1.0
21,en-US,349.510016,19.109990399999997,And what was happening at that cottage what was happening with all the soldiers and the women that worked at this is just fascinating fascinating history And of course it is Uh You know he can Uh we find out the answer at the end which was something I Um I didn't see coming,0.99,1.0
22,en-US,370.5400064,19.1399936,Um I was hoping for something like the ending was going to be like oh please please let it end up like this And Um but it's just a little twists and turns throughout this story everywhere He does a great job I think of portraying people and real life situations and decisions that they have to make and that we see,0.96,1.0
23,en-US,389.68,18.6599936,as genealogists going back in time and looking at these documents You know you're always wondering how these people really like And I think that Uh Nathan does a good job of bringing Um Uh images and the life And I appreciate in his stories that there's there's a lot of tragedy,0.97,1.0
24,en-US,408.54999039999996,12.060006399999999,I mean he brings a lot of tragedy to life you know in passbooks you know with there There was one I can't remember which one it was but the the Um the young girl was a servant and she's in this home,0.95,1.0
25,en-US,420.6099968,17.460019199999998,And you know what she had to go through And it doesn't really always have a happy ending Now we when we look at these are our ancestors or whoever Yeah Yeah And you realize I was looking at Um a census the other day and the woman had 11 children and she had only two surviving in nineteen hundred,0.98,1.0
26,en-US,438.4300032,14.699980799999999,So she this woman has lost nine children And then before she died she lost another child So yeah 10 children dead So we see that And he's in he really sticks to that It's not there's not always happiness in his boxers,0.94,1.0
27,en-US,453.21999359999995,24.959999999999997,You know it's pretty straightforward Um But he does get records really quickly Morton Barrere the hero of the story gives DNA tests back from ancestry in what 24 48 hours turned backward I was like really So now I made the mention at the end in the notes that you know it is fictionalized because that's really fiction,0.91,1.0
28,en-US,478.4800256,23.429990399999998,Yeah Yeah Um But it's funny because the story also uses DNA to help To help solve Yes Uh Or to resolve It does It does Uh And it gives you some of the places that he goes to look for Documents Um also can spark Uh something in in us that I hadn't thought about going there because look at that goes to a,0.96,1.0
29,en-US,501.910016,16.649984,military museum and looks at the records and the photographs And this book does rely on photographs And Martin very does rely on photographs Yeah As well Yes And photographs in newspapers too Just ran to how he found you know just by topics not necessarily by looking at the person,0.91,1.0
30,en-US,518.6500096,13.44,Exactly And those people show that So a lot of things to think about in our personal research You know you can get from this but we both highly recommend Um his book series Uh Nathan Dylan Goodwin's books for Martin farriers,0.93,1.0
31,en-US,532.5399552,16.4200448,And is there a link on our website Yes They're all on our Web site You can just go there and click right through and get them And there they're all on Amazon It's such a great series Now another thing something that came up in the book that I thought was interesting was Um the genealogist,0.95,1.0
32,en-US,548.979968,14.8200448,He is of course looking for his birth father throughout the series and he is given Well I don't want to give too much away He comes across some letters that he believes were written from his biological father to his biological mother,0.98,1.0
33,en-US,564.2199552,14.160025599999999,Now his mother is still alive and in the book And so Uh I thought that it was you know that's kind of a conflict there of you know And so I started looking into you know is it proper to read someone else's letters,0.98,1.0
34,en-US,578.409984,17.129984,Because yeah letters are something that genealogy should all be relying on And we love it when we find old letters And certainly people who are deceased no longer have privacy rights So if someone is deceased Um you know reading their letters isn't such a big deal as if they're still alive,0.99,1.0
35,en-US,595.9899647999999,19.8300672,So and and the character in the book Um has that conflict You know should I read these letters Should I turn them over to the person that they were intended for Hmm And I did a little digging Um on the Internet because I was kind of curious to see what else was out there and Um ran across Um the family curator,0.99,1.0
36,en-US,615.820032,19.6699648,NORCOM It's a genealogical web A blog I think And Um there's an article on there about ethics etiquette and old family letters Oh and Um the questions are is it morally correct ethical to read other people's mail and is it socially acceptable proper etiquette to do so,0.98,1.0
37,en-US,636.1500159999999,21.620019199999998,And Uh I think that going through the article Uh they bring up some interesting points But at the end of the day it's really about Um it's really up to the individual Oh OK There was a Um brother and sister who found some letters that their mother had had left her grandmother had left and they decided not a journal,0.99,1.0
38,en-US,657.7800192,15.389952,I know it was a journal that they had run across after their mother died and Um had some not so nice things written in it about other family members And they decided that that was not something that their mother had would want to have published or make it publicly known,0.96,1.0
39,en-US,673.1699712,14.700032,And it would probably cause some issues within the family So they decided to destroy that journal Uh Oh yeah I think I would have destroyed her I can't really put it away for future generations when those generations were so far back,0.98,1.0
40,en-US,687.9600128,16.7099904,Who cares Right Right So definitely something that we Uh we need to think about as as genealogists because I think we get so excited about finding more information and Um the information that that's in in those letters that we really have to think about how we're going to use those ideas,0.96,1.0
41,en-US,704.7499776,14.6200064,And you know maybe you don't publish it but you don't destroy it Right You hang on to it Um You know I was reading Uh I'm reading Um the Hemingses of Monticello and talking about Jefferson and his first wife and there's almost no correspondence from her,0.96,1.0
42,en-US,719.650048,16.5799424,So it's very hard to know who she was and Uh because he destroyed all of their correspondence So Uh you know just like oh my gosh you know this woman she has really nothing written about her You know we don't know who she was so Um we wouldn't wish that he had it,0.97,1.0
43,en-US,736.4400128,16.2500096,Yes of course Um So those are things to think about You know what is that information going to do to other people Hmm I had that in Um my family There was a Um an illegitimate child Um And you know should I put that person on my ancestry tree,0.98,1.0
44,en-US,752.7000064,15.820032,Because the record is out there now and just as illegitimate I was born in the eighteen hundreds but Um the descendants of that father biological father are out there you know Do I want to bring them into that Do they need to know that,0.95,1.0
45,en-US,768.5399552,13.520025599999999,I don't know I think And I think Um that's a good question And for me it would be the time period if you're talking Eighteen hundreds Well he was born at 18 in 98 So the late last year hundreds,0.89,1.0
46,en-US,782.070016,11.809996799999999,Okay That's a little more recent You know he could have grand nephews and nieces probably from his father who are still still alive So you know did they know about that relationship and that family I don't know Yeah,0.97,1.0
47,en-US,794.3400448,17.2799488,I decided I have the information in my files but I just didn't put it on ancestry because my my family tree is public So yeah On ancestry Um So yeah I guess it'd be interesting like if you found this that person on another family site or whatever and you knew they were a direct line and they were they,0.97,1.0
48,en-US,811.6199935999999,10.5900032,knew it was an illegitimate birth and they were OK with it then maybe OK somebody else is out there with it Right But if you can't find it anywhere and nobody has this would have been my mother's uncle,0.98,1.0
49,en-US,822.5100288,12.409958399999999,And he never he never married and he never had any any children So it to me it just didn't seem like I needed to trust her That is too recent maybe Exactly But Um but I do have the information in my file,0.92,1.0
50,en-US,834.9299712,11.190016,So these are things that we just need to stop for a moment and think about I guess genealogist before we move forward and how we're going to treat that information Right So and well that brings up Uh other things too,0.95,1.0
51,en-US,846.1300223999999,18.739967999999998,You know in the book Um they did do the DNA test to to find family relation And Um two things on that with the privacy issue One is I mean I had my dad and his cousin do a DNA test recently but they just did it for fun,0.97,1.0
52,en-US,865.0500096,14.999961599999999,Pretty much too Um But to find out Um to make sure they were actually cousins and that was a hard thing to bring Uh up Um to them and saying hey you know your grandparents didn't get married till after your dad was born,0.98,1.0
53,en-US,880.0700416,12.4899328,I mean it was a really hard thing to bring up but they were both really OK with it And I think just coming to the person and asking it you know and bringing it up And it turns out they were first cousins,0.99,1.0
54,en-US,892.5599744,13.6200192,And you know I don't know what the whole story is behind why this couple chose to wait till after the birth of the baby to get married Um But yeah And I'd be a letter will turn up somewhere or the answer to that question,0.97,1.0
55,en-US,906.5399295999999,12.8100352,I've heard other Uh professional genealogist or other genealogists who do work for other people Um you know get into situations where they've had Uh you know DNA tests You know the family wants a DNA test and some of those results come back,0.96,1.0
56,en-US,919.5800575999999,14.2099456,Not what's expected or you have one person in the family who is refusing to DNA test And you know you can't figure out why Well maybe there is a reason why the rest of family doesn't know more There is a suspicion there,0.95,1.0
57,en-US,933.8000384,18.6599424,So we have to be very sensitive and not so gung ho in our pursuit of our Uh Uh genealogical research to understand that there are you know especially doing DNA test now You know you're dealing with living people and the consequences Uh Um of actions that happened a long time ago,0.98,1.0
58,en-US,952.4599807999999,12.1800704,And oftentimes those people may not be around to explain Yeah so so be careful when you take your DNA test Be sure that you're ready to accept anything that might show up Right And that would lead me to an article,0.96,1.0
59,en-US,966.0499967999999,21.3900288,Um And I just got this yesterday the American ancestors by the New England Historic Genealogical Society their magazine had an Um article in there What actually is on the cover It's with Bill Griffiths book The Stranger in My Genes How DNA Tests Turned a TV turned TV anchor Bill Griffith's World Upside Down,0.95,1.0
60,en-US,987.7999616,11.9600128,I thought oh interesting I'm going to read that article And it turns out the article was the first chapter in his book which of course at the very end I'm like what Now I have to get the book to find the answer,0.99,1.0
61,en-US,999.7700096,11.52,I mean I am hooked on your high head I'm hooked It was such a good Um beginning But he was encouraged by his cousin to take a DNA test and it came back that his father was not his father,0.94,1.0
62,en-US,1011.4199552,12.2800128,Yeah What Yeah You know so you have to be prepared for that that it might something like that might come back His father is no longer living I haven't gotten that far That wasn't I don't I don't think so,0.96,1.0
63,en-US,1023.7100032,12.5100032,His mother is living his mother's life So yeah No I don't think his father is living but his mother is still alive And apparently Um there's a Q&A after this And it says something that you know she was helpful and answering questions,0.93,1.0
64,en-US,1036.2200063999999,12.2399744,But you know how do you bring that up to your mom Hey mom you know did you have an affair I don't know what the deal here Um That probably would have been me I probably would've stomping right over there going what is the meaning of this,0.97,1.0
65,en-US,1050.9499392,20.1299968,But you know it is a very sensitive issue And again privacy You know what If the mother doesn't want to tell you what happened Uh that happened to you I think the archbishop of Canterbury Uh earlier this year or the end of last year I mean when they went public with it that Um there had been rumors I guess Uh that,0.99,1.0
66,en-US,1071.0799359999999,14.670028799999999,his Um father who raised him was perhaps not his biological father And so he agreed to take a DNA test and in fact showed that the man who raised him was not his biological father So Yeah Yeah Surprise Right,0.98,1.0
67,en-US,1085.8800128,15.5200512,Yeah So those surprises are out there But I still would encourage everyone to do a DNA test and and put it out there and and don't be Uh and be willing to share to find your your cousin connections and whatnot,0.98,1.0
68,en-US,1101.400064,16.019968,And there's so many things can turn up Um from these DNA tests I have to say this wine gets better with every step you know and it's a very good omen Um OK so we've covered that stuff And there were,0.9,1.0
69,en-US,1117.5799808,26.1900288,How about current research What are you working on Well Um I found I'm working on Uh something interesting I have someone Um contact me because my tree is public on ancestry to encourage Um collaboration And someone Uh contacted me recently Um regarding actually this is my late husband's second great grandmother and Um had some information wanted to share it with me and asked me,0.97,1.0
70,en-US,1143.8000127999999,12.6900224,if I knew anything else because the surnames were not matching up And I had done some research on that line but on the Um paternal side and not so much on the maternal side So I start I pull up my notes and pull up the information I had,0.97,1.0
71,en-US,1156.4900352,20.219904,And Um my late husband's Um aunt was a very good genealogist And so we relied on Uh her notes and her family group sheets her research Um to really jump start the research on to that line And then I've been going through and then actually documenting the information that she had on her Uh family group sheets,0.95,1.0
72,en-US,1177.6999424,20.009984,Occasionally she would actually cite some some sources but for the most part Um there's no citations And I came to realize to my horror that the I had sort of made some assumptions Uh that I had not really analyzed the evidence Um on that maternal line Um and I had not done research really on it,0.97,1.0
73,en-US,1197.7199616,20.1500672,So I started analyzing that and realizing that Um there was a marriage There must have been another marriage because Uh we we know that the mother had married twice and that the father had died But when she married the second time she married under a different surname,0.98,1.0
74,en-US,1219.2,13.379993599999999,So it wasn't her first husband surname that she married under but her daughter's husband was one of the witnesses So I was pretty sure that was her Yeah sure And so then I thought well oh my gosh did did the first wife die,0.98,1.0
75,en-US,1232.5999616,15.1901184,And did the father marry a second woman by the same first name you know and Um then all of sudden we have this right So all of a sudden we have another surname thrown in there And Uh you know there's definitely a conflict of Um evidence,0.97,1.0
76,en-US,1247.8900224,15.2900608,So delving into that a little bit and luckily I was able to find I cannot find that second marriage as of yet Um but I did find the marriage bond on Family Search Zorg which I love family search dot org for marriages,0.96,1.0
77,en-US,1263.56992,14.070067199999999,So they're just that's great And not only did I find the marriage license which had Um only the names and the witnesses but it actually had the marriage bond And the bond says that she had been married twice Excellent,0.98,1.0
78,en-US,1277.7700352,13.7399296,That's the only clue I have that that she after her first husband died she remarried and must have been remarried quickly because you know she's in the 1860 census She's not in the 1870 census And this is in 1873 marriage,0.96,1.0
79,en-US,1291.5300352,15.539916799999999,So she married between 1860 and 1873 at twice Wow So working on that right now But all thanks to Um this individual who's not related to Uh he's actually related to the second husband's family or the third husband's family now their second husband,0.96,1.0
80,en-US,1307.3999872,10.4399872,And he was just trying to clarify you know where did that name come from You know based on the information I had on my tree it was not obviously well it is accurate but I don't have that other marriage on there,0.99,1.0
81,en-US,1317.8399743999998,15.2100864,So that's fine Sharing that Um really made me look at you Uh at the evidence I think and analyzing it That's helpful to just to think of when you started your tree on ancestry or in whatever venue you're putting your tree,0.96,1.0
82,en-US,1333.4398976,17.4001152,How long ago was that You know and have you gone back to look at some of these people Because I'm sure mine are the same way and sometimes I'm guilty of Um putting in names And I'll take an example for what I'm working on now which you helped me with the birth line,0.99,1.0
83,en-US,1351.529984,20.760064,Um And then I dropped him like a hot potato didn't I You did But I'm still hoping that you're going to be like They were just not useful to my purpose at that point And Um so my Bergland anyway we've kind of found my John Jr. BERC which my grandmother has written his name and we find him as John,0.92,1.0
84,en-US,1372.2900479999998,14.6400256,Jay Burke Um that his father also is a John Byrne And we pretty much confirmed that he is the one in the 1860 census that has these brothers and sisters James Alexander and Elizabeth Um But none of them have tested their DNA,0.96,1.0
85,en-US,1387.0199808,14.719999999999999,Right Nobody in those family lines that I know of has tested for their DNA to make a man dad your dad and your cousin don't have much Oh so frustrated uncle Um But the Alexander is listed on the guardianship papers Um for the two little boys of John Burke,0.94,1.0
86,en-US,1401.750016,22.0798976,So that makes that connection there Um But to connect them to this John Burke there's a Uh variety of John's not a lot of a couple out there that could be there their father But the one that looks most promising is one that's in Um Montgomery Township or Uh County Ohio whose wife is Elizabeth Winthrop,0.98,1.0
87,en-US,1424.2499584,18.180096,And so I just put them on the tree because that way I can get little hints or whatever Right That is not definitely documented or anything like that And I know that I know I'm putting it out there as undocumented information but it's I'm just trying to see what I can pull once it's out there,0.99,1.0
88,en-US,1442.4699904,11.650048,Yeah I do that too Um Definitely do that But some but what's hard is when you leave it and you forget about it for a few years and then you find out you were wrong And you know here that's been there for years,0.97,1.0
89,en-US,1454.1299712,16.0,So Uh when you were talking about your story it made me think of all the things I've got on my mom's side of the family that I've done exactly this to Oh I think this is it Let me put them out there and then I don't go back and Um revisit,0.99,1.0
90,en-US,1470.1500416,13.6500224,Right And refresh and make a decision Yes this is or this isn't And that shouldn't be sitting out there because I don't want to give other people false information that this is true But I am using that site you know to try to find out the truth,0.97,1.0
91,en-US,1483.8899712,8.620032,Right So you put stuff out there that may or may not be true because you want to see what pops You will see what else comes up because that is the one good thing about ancestry is that you do get those pops,0.94,1.0
92,en-US,1492.5500416,19.1698944,A lot of them are wrong but you will get some that are Um that are accurate or that do lead you to at least eliminate that possibility Right Or to cooperate with you what your I think But and that's why it's so important that we don't copy information off of other people's rights use it use it for clues,0.97,1.0
93,en-US,1511.7299712,13.0700288,Is that you do not just copy Yes And you just I mean because you can just see the same repeated error over and over again when you look Those trees you know the same you know four or five different people have Covid the same information and it's all inaccurate,0.98,1.0
94,en-US,1524.8300032,9.299968,I've seen people that have copied mine when I put a wrong person down and I find out it's not and I change it but I go back and here's all these trees that put that person up there And I know,0.96,1.0
95,en-US,1535.0899712,16.5000192,So that's why I kind of feel guilty about putting them up there in the research of this person the researchers responsible That's true So yes that is true And then that also Um makes me think of when I was contacting people that had either a website or Um I found on Wiki tree,0.93,1.0
96,en-US,1551.9799295999999,14.790041599999999,If you've ever used WeiQi Tree you should you should definitely go there because that's a collaborative effort as well Um and sent Uh a little private messages to those people Um to see if they have anything because they don't have any sources or documents listed on their site,0.97,1.0
97,en-US,1566.7699711999999,14.210047999999999,And I'm like OK well you've connected all these people together too How do you make that connection What are your sources Maybe we can share Um So I'm waiting to hear back on on that because those are some of the the descendants of some of that,0.97,1.0
98,en-US,1580.989952,11.1500288,There's other Berzerk siblings right Yes Your John Yes One line is from the Alexander and one line is from the James So I'm trying to say of course none of these people have done a DNA test So Uh Right,0.94,1.0
99,en-US,1592.1500159999998,15.370035199999998,Which is great They can They can But they're both the men the male line so they can do some DNA testing That would really clear how you guys And you had found for me Um some great obituaries from the Finley Library the Finley Hancock County Library,0.89,1.0
100,en-US,1607.5400192,24.3600384,Yeah See the genealogists there is just in Crawford Yes he is amazing He's wonderful He's just in your great love Just and Uh he's done a lot for me in the past But he sent you some things and there were Um some great addresses in there that I went on to Google Earth and started plotting where my ancestor lived,0.94,1.0
101,en-US,1632.8299519999998,16.5300224,Um But from the census I went through the census from when he was Um living with his great uncle before he was farmed out as an indentured servant Um to that farm or at least the area of the farm The farm didn't really have an address to his home after he got married,1.0,1.0
102,en-US,1649.4499839999999,15.2100864,And then another Uh he moved like three times and five years in that same dresses from the city directory from the city directory and and from the obituaries One of them had never torture But yes he sent Justin sent us there or sent you the Um directories,0.92,1.0
103,en-US,1664.6600704,19.0798848,So that was really helpful And turns out he was in partnership I guess with his brother in law Um Mirit Curtis running a grocery store And you're this individual that you're talking about right now He we thought you found him in the 1880 census as what a 13 year old a teenager working on a farm,0.97,1.0
