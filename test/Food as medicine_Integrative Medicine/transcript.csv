0,en-US,0.12,12.42,Photoshop good evening to you thanks for joining us It's good to be here Nice to meet you know same same So tonight we talk about something interesting that we talking about food for medicine for medicine food as medicine food as medicine,0.91,1.0
1,en-US,12.57,13.86,Yes it's awesome So basically the conversation started a couple of weeks ago that we Uh we put it up just the context of how food can make a difference in people's lives And it's not just food as edible as food has purpose,0.95,1.0
2,en-US,26.43,20.009999999999998,Few days meaning food has context in your life and it needs to be decided and choices made specifically about what goes in your system and they fix it can have on you Um Hmm My guest tonight is a friend of mine who's Um been known as Dr. Korrell Um and he has Uh quite an interesting point of view about this and,0.95,1.0
3,en-US,46.44,13.44,an interesting life pause when it comes to the understanding of nutrition and the benefits of it for us Mm hmm Um so I'll introduce Dr. Crow Dr. Carl Good evening to you Thanks for joining us Good evening And yeah you were all humble when I met you,0.91,1.0
4,en-US,59.879999999999995,17.82,And I'm like you are You said I'm cuddle You know there was you know he didn't prefix it but no Nice to meet you Um Let me let me start from the perspective that I many years ago I worked for someone that's passionate about food and not from the I don't know Um Uh what's this thing you know the these,0.98,1.0
5,en-US,77.7,13.7700032,cooking shows perspective but more Uh someone that understood the value of food and the impact that it has on someone's long term health especially Uh children's welfare and what difference it actually makes in their lives Um And I learned a lot about that,0.99,1.0
6,en-US,91.4700032,13.199993599999999,And I mean I assume that or at least my assumption was was that yes nutrition is an important role to play from that perspective I didn't really think much about it beyond that You're going to fill in those gaps for us that it is,0.95,1.0
7,en-US,104.66999679999999,22.7400128,It's an ongoing journey with food right Most definitely Um 100 200 years ago we didn't have medicines other than foods herbs and and all of these things And Um the idea with food as medicine is to not necessarily have to grab for something that is a synthetic medicine that you put into your body that has a lot of side,0.99,1.0
8,en-US,127.4100096,20.009984,effects Um And we call this Uh integrative medicine And the whole concept of integrative medicine is not to say that allopathic medicine is wrong We want to say that let's use the best for the current situation So best of both worlds basically,1.0,1.0
9,en-US,148.0499968,17.5699968,And I'm very lucky to be able to work with some brilliant medical doctors who combine allopathic and more natural medicines to customize medicine per patient It's also not an idea that we you you walk in there and they say this is your problem,0.99,1.0
10,en-US,165.6199936,23.290009599999998,My flowcharts is this and this is your medicine Yeah Um And that's where food as medicine comes in really really Uh big time because you everybody is different Your genetic makeup is different and your taste differs So we teach people how to use their food as medicine and how to make better bad decisions in the environment that we live,0.96,1.0
11,en-US,188.9100032,19.950003199999998,in these days That's quite fascinating Um You know and thanks for sort of giving me a new word that I've learned tonight And that's allopathic Um because I'm one of those people that devotes immediately to the allopathic blogs Right Um I have people that have been listening to me for long enough know for a fact that my my general theory,0.96,1.0
12,en-US,208.8600064,17.6699904,is if you're not wearing a white lab coat and you know you don't give me a bunch of pills we don't inject me with something I tend not to trust you Right That's my approach And I think that applies for many people because inasmuch as Um and then I don't want to just use a blanket term alternative medicines,0.95,1.0
13,en-US,226.54999039999998,13.8700032,Right But as much as alternative medicines is becoming something people are paying attention to It's also something people are becoming very wary of because of the bad information out there So so so what you're basically saying is that you're not dismissing the allopathic stuff,0.98,1.0
14,en-US,240.4199936,13.219993599999999,You're not saying hey don't take your next paracetamol tablet Right Ever again What you're saying is is that instead of just reaching for paracetamol there might be a food substitute Is that am I understanding you correctly Yes definitely,0.97,1.0
15,en-US,253.6499968,16.5200128,So Um One of the big concepts that we work with is that for a an acute situation if you break your arm you're not going to take vitamin C you're going to want morphine So Um and that's why we say we don't dismiss allopathic medicine,0.98,1.0
16,en-US,271.71000319999996,23.689984,Um But there are times that vitamin C might work better Hmm Um Or in conjunction with Um I'm blessed to be able to work a lot with cancer patients and people going through through cancer journeys And we see a lot that people still go for chemo and radiation but they always that through their lifestyle and the nutrition we can support,0.98,1.0
17,en-US,295.4099968,19.5700224,the body through this big big Uh change that is Going through and through the chemo and radiation and it's not Uh and I mean we need to put it into perspective there as well because I mean obviously when we talk about food in this instance Um it's all encompassing I presume because I mean I know for a fact that there's,0.98,1.0
18,en-US,314.98001919999996,11.84,nothing that makes me feel better on a Saturday Uh watching the rugby having a nice rack of ribs in front of you You know some nice fried meat Exactly You know but we're not talking about and it makes me feel good,0.98,1.0
19,en-US,326.8299776,15.9900416,It doesn't necessarily make me feel healthy or it doesn't necessarily improve my life Yes Uh But but Uh it is But but to be encompassing food what what is our definition of food in this instance Well it actually does include like the meats and the breu,0.96,1.0
20,en-US,343.2399872,13.0500096,So what we say to a lot of people is if you do have the Brei Just make sure that you have onions garlic and some broccoli with it because the the burnt meat can cause cancer It has of course in Hoogendyk effect,0.97,1.0
21,en-US,357.1300096,25.5599872,So Um if you upregulated your liver detoxification through Uh specifically broccoli you can then mitigate the risk of getting cancer Um And that's why we also then say make better bad decisions So add things that will help afterwards And Um like you also rightly said a lot of the the natural people all naturally inclined people,0.98,1.0
22,en-US,384.7500032,13.769984,Um Do spread a lot of misinformation And on the Internet you get the one side will say you know use apricot kernels for for cancer and other one would say no it kills you because of the cyanide So what do you really believe,0.99,1.0
23,en-US,399.0000128,17.0099968,And Um that's what we in the practice try to do is just to empower people to make those decisions and make informed decisions about the medicine and the lifestyle So I'll pick up on that because not too long ago Um the issue of food is a substitute,0.99,1.0
24,en-US,416.0100096,11.6699904,And please note what I'm using It would substitute food as a substitute for medication Yes Was a very contentious issue in this country and something that I feel very strongly about because I was a student at the time,0.96,1.0
25,en-US,429.0899968,12.0900096,Um Uh I was a law student You know it's still busy studying law and Uh people that are you know in essence within civil society circles today people like Mark Heywood They made a mess of fight over this issue So we'll get to that in a couple,0.97,1.0
26,en-US,441.4500352,12.809984,I want to come back to you Photoshop because in as much as you know Dr. Godel is your guest I don't want to completely exclude you out of this No I guess that you don't But I mean but this is an important question because especially for people that want to exercise stay fit,0.92,1.0
27,en-US,455.19001599999996,14.070015999999999,Uh Do they thing Um I remember when Um I used to play rugby at varsity level I'm but of Uh I'm a lot heavier now than what I was then I mean between then and now Twenty seven kg happened you know quickly and not very quickly,0.9,1.0
28,en-US,469.26003199999997,8.939980799999999,It actually and this is the sad thing is that when I needed the additional twenty seven kg it was just not there So what do we do We start using the protein shakes and we use the What what what,0.93,1.0
29,en-US,478.4999936,12.660019199999999,And and really largely because you're a student and you recognize that your daily protein intake and whatever other Uh you know other supplements you need is not supplemented through the food you eating And that is not out of choice mind you,0.98,1.0
30,en-US,491.45999359999996,16.3500032,That is simply because you're living in the days You've signed up for two meals a day And those two meals a day are nutritious but not probably specific to your needs Right So what do you do You go by the big Uh can of Um of protein shakes,0.96,1.0
31,en-US,507.82003199999997,13.1899904,And to make matters worse Um I think I told the listeners about this a couple of months ago Uh in my fourth year my second last year at Varsity Goudge goes and picks up tuberculosis So again I lose weight suddenly,0.97,1.0
32,en-US,521.3100032,13.799987199999999,So why do I have to do I have to use protein shakes just to get you know some body mass back But I mean especially for young people for people that are active people that want to do some conditioning some but not bodybuilding but you know pick up good weight,0.98,1.0
33,en-US,535.1399936,18.6300416,Sure Um Can you do it via food Because a common myth is this You will never be able to eat enough to build good muscle into I don't agree with the supplementation So from my life and purposes in my life I don't recommend supplementation from that form at all,0.97,1.0
34,en-US,554.5499648,13.92,Um I run a business Uh based on a lifestyle based on non supplementation of an artificial stimulant so you can do it through food It's a common thing that it's that you can go to a pharmacy or a shop and pick up Uh a Uh way protein,0.97,1.0
35,en-US,569.4000128,10.4699904,Um It seems to be a a marketing thing At the moment I'm struggling with that People can just go out and get stuff and purchase it without understanding what's in it And the quantities are not necessarily right for you,0.97,1.0
36,en-US,579.8700031999999,11.52,And the absorption rate and the actual contents are not necessarily tested or understood So are we taking these things based on a philosophy that that I don't believe in anymore Um So I do believe you can do it naturally,0.97,1.0
37,en-US,591.7499904,15.390003199999999,I don't think you need as much protein as what people say we do I think we eating way too much Um and to build muscle does require excess protein or or a larger amount of protein Buffalonian per day But I don't think you can necessarily get it from an artificial point of view,0.97,1.0
38,en-US,607.1699967999999,10.140006399999999,So again the lifestyle's difficult You can't always go and get tuna or fish or chicken or a more natural sense of protein or you people don't even understand the fact that you can get it from a vegetable protein,0.97,1.0
39,en-US,618.5999872,14.3699968,Um So the choices people make are limited to what they understand And I think we we're not necessarily exposed to the truth that that that is probably a little bit more interesting and varied Um But you don't need to supplement in order to pick up weight,0.97,1.0
40,en-US,633.12,16.979968,So I disagree with that Uh But what else I find interesting about that I mean you talk about that you know I'm lucky in that the work that I've done is I've I've you know being able to a travel a bit Um be interact with people from especially Europe you know Europeans,0.93,1.0
41,en-US,650.3400448,12.619980799999999,The one big comment they make especially if they come to South Africa is geez you guys eat a lot of meat you know and it's become a staple It's standard and it's Um it's a conversation my wife and I had Uh because I did a show,0.98,1.0
42,en-US,663.0300159999999,13.169971199999999,She also read an article about this and she said you know about how Um in terms of global climate change you can actually make a massive impact if you have meat free Mondays Uh for example Right Because you may need to eat less beef as an example,0.98,1.0
43,en-US,676.8,16.259993599999998,Uh Less beef means less methane from Uh cow farts and burps literally So you know all of those things Um add up eventually So we spoke about the whole idea of meat free Mondays but there is something weird for me and I think it's not just a cultural thing,0.99,1.0
44,en-US,693.0599936,19.1699968,It's it's really how I grew up It's conditioning and socialization like about sitting down for dinner and then not being a meat Uh you know whether it be a slab of meat or some chicken or mince or whatever else or whatever if it's not on their plate it just doesn't seem Uh you know it just doesn't seem like food,0.95,1.0
45,en-US,712.2599935999999,10.5299968,So let's talk we'll talk about that in a couple in terms of what how do we change the dynamic Because I think it's a reality in South Africa that that's how we eat We've been brought up Sure Uh And it's cross-cultural,0.98,1.0
46,en-US,722.8499968,16.5199872,Hundred percent because I even find that Uh Uh you know our Indian Uh community in South Africa and some of whom are vegetarian because of religious reasons Uh substitute have as meat substitutes in the form of Um a meat shaped item But it's soya right,0.95,1.0
47,en-US,739.3800192,16.859955199999998,So it just shows that that meat that idea of meat must accompany your meal is almost ingrained Right So we'll talk about that in a couple Dr. Kartal coming back to you So Uh what I was saying earlier on was that we had Um minister of health once upon a time called Dr. Mantha Shovel Hellam Simba who herself didn't,0.95,1.0
48,en-US,756.2399743999999,25.720063999999997,have the healthiest lifestyle Yeah we all know how she unfortunately you know Uh succumbed eventually Right But she and this is the one issue that I think still remains Um a serious concern for most South Africans is that we had Um her at the time as well as Tabo Mbeki Uh running a policy that said that when ARV's were clearly evidence,0.99,1.0
49,en-US,781.9799552,11.9100416,Yes Allopathic mind you that they prolong the lives of people living with HIV that these two were sticking their heads in the sand and saying no all that you need is garlic beetroot and a couple of other things,0.97,1.0
50,en-US,794.3099904,19.1699968,Now what my contention is I'm not saying that whatever Um whatever the African potato is I'm not saying that the African potato does not necessarily assist Yes In you know through nutrition and in keeping you healthy But surely the African potato cannot become a substitute for drugs that prolong your life,0.97,1.0
51,en-US,814.1699583999999,22.8900352,Or do I have it misunderstood In some instances it can Um Not necessarily the African potato Um If you take for example the Uh Uh vitamin that we use at the moment Uh which is difficult to get in the country B 17 which is derived from apricot kernels and Um people can eat the apricot kernel as a cancer therapy,0.98,1.0
52,en-US,837.4799872,26.640025599999998,All they can have the extract inject it as an IV Mm hmm And Um we had I was I was stealing from lunch just before we started Um about two gentlemen who the doctors contacted Um him today and said we don't believe it but you don't have cancer in your lungs anymore from B 17 and vitamin C injections,0.92,1.0
53,en-US,864.6899712,21.480038399999998,That was after they gave up hope on him Uh with allopathic medicine So again it works for some people It is just like your your allopathic medicine It's not going to work for everybody Hmm It again depends on your genetic makeup and Um your lifestyle and also,0.98,1.0
54,en-US,887.6900352,14.909951999999999,Things like the African potato can be used as a supplementary therapy And that's where the correct information needs to be sent out into the world where you get people who believe that Um for example cannabis is a cure all,1.0,1.0
55,en-US,903.2600576,18.3300096,I know And it's something that keeps on coming up And I'm actually surprised that I haven't had an SMS or a WhatsApp or you know social media coming sort of telling me that you Um you know you just need cannabis oil to sort everything out Um which which I mean I look at it and I'm like yeah great guys,0.98,1.0
56,en-US,921.5900671999999,15.4699776,And I know in the US there's Uh I mean there's there's two city types of states in the US right now where where cannabis is completely legal Yes We cannabis is legal for medical reasons And we're cannabis is legal for Uh both recreational and legal purposes,0.96,1.0
57,en-US,937.0699775999999,22.1400064,Right I mean and medical purposes And I think that it's perhaps in my opinion also very smart marketing ploy on behalf of those people you know the ones that are able to because it's become industrialized So yes a bloke that became an overnight billionaire as his state was busy lobbying to Uh legalize Dakka what he was doing was,0.96,1.0
58,en-US,959.209984,16.32,he was going ahead and finding out what other products it can produce with the thing He started manufacturing in a large scale and getting all the equipment that he needed And so the moment Colorado Um you know made the use of natural cannabis whatever we call it legal,0.95,1.0
59,en-US,975.830016,15.9899648,This guy brought all the stuff over from Mexico It became a billionaire within months Yes You know and I think that it's you know if you have a couple of people on Facebook and on email and on Twitter promoting the thing for you and you don't have to take out expensive TV or radio ads it's even better,0.98,1.0
60,en-US,992.1800192,18.6500096,But I mean I hear what you're saying But there was this one issue that I wanted to raise who said look genetically allopathic medicine might not work So in other words the death paracetamol or the whatever the artery that's helping for Uh person age might not be Uh you know suitable for my genetic makeup as person B,0.93,1.0
61,en-US,1010.8699647999999,19.9200768,Am I correct in my understanding there Yes But surely then when we talk about food Mm hmm Isn't that also a similar situation Because we heard recently that we have people that have genetics That's where carbs are fine for them Uh with genetics for example is tells you that carbs aren't good for another group or you know and,0.97,1.0
62,en-US,1030.7900416,22.9799936,so on and so forth So the one diet doesn't necessarily suit either diet Most definitely And Um it is exactly the same thing So if you have a Uh genetic predisposition where your liver Uh one of your detox Uh Um pathways doesn't work then you can have as much garlic as you want to or your cruciferous vegetables,0.99,1.0
63,en-US,1054.0100608,22.4099328,It's not going to help you You don't need to abrogate the other four pathways Okay So Um and that's where again Um integrative medicine takes a look sometimes one step deeper And we do the genetic tests that not many people are aware of are available even in South Africa,0.96,1.0
64,en-US,1077.2299776,14.7600384,And Um so so the food Yes it works exactly the same as medicines It is going to work better for some people than for others And that's way that I think the practice of medicine moves more into the realm of being an art form,0.99,1.0
65,en-US,1093.0100224,17.069977599999998,But the difficulty is and then and I'm not saying that this this might be my own ignorance or this might be my own Um level of skepticism Remember let's go back to what I said initially Most definitely unless and until it's my programing I guess my mom was a nurse you know Um recently retired,0.94,1.0
66,en-US,1110.08,12.7200256,And I'm programed that if it's not a white lab coat you know if it's not Um if there's an injury and going in for the X-rays or whatever Yes There's something that sort of makes me nervous about it Yes,0.97,1.0
67,en-US,1122.8299264,14.1300736,Right So what I'm just saying is is that for the person listening at home right now if we could tweet the the the basic principle I don't know if it's possible Yes And please if I'm Uh if it's not possible to do that please Uh pointed up,0.96,1.0
68,en-US,1136.96,19.049984,But if you could tweet in 140 characters and say to someone this is the general principle when it comes to food versus the allopathic stuff either in combination or in isolation what would that be Keep it doesn't have to be and in fact know that Uh keep a healthy balance,0.97,1.0
69,en-US,1156.6999552,16.050073599999997,OK It'll just be that and be aware of that balance Let's get back to you in Russia Um and then you see how I'm doing it I'm splitting it between the health aspect And then obviously I mean not to say that they neither one of them don't pay a health role,0.96,1.0
70,en-US,1172.7500287999999,14.3099904,Do they obviously play a significant health role But I want to get back to the exercise stuff So the one thing that I know you know having played rugby having you know hit the gym with friends et cetera et cetera always being a bit of a lightweight but quite active you know,0.97,1.0
71,en-US,1187.180032,14.2798848,A particular point in my life the one thing that stood out was the amount of damage you guys were doing to themselves I mean not talking about guys that were juicing and juicing is when people use steroids and that type of thing which is obviously at the other Uh extreme end of of being harmful,0.96,1.0
72,en-US,1203.2900095999998,19.2899072,We talking about people that Um were using the protein shakes Uh Um What else is the other thing Creatine that's very popular is it not of liver and kidney damage And I think that's something that people should be aware of is that you can get these really beautiful packaged big cans that make you feel like a muscle man just by,0.94,1.0
73,en-US,1222.5799167999999,12.8301056,buying it But it's dangerous stuff and harmful stuff It is If you know and I don't want to throw anyone under the bus you know from a marketing perspective But I mean the point is is that you need to be careful of what you taking,1.0,1.0
74,en-US,1235.4100224,11.500032,I think you don't understand what is actually in a lot of these containers that you buy It's sold as as like you say a boat package You get the pools with the powder and you mix it and within a month it costs you this amount of money and will save it by buying in bulk,0.94,1.0
75,en-US,1247.1800832,16.8699904,But what are the ingredients of the content that's in it and how much is your body actually needing So I do think there's a marketing issue to it I do think that it's misleading and it's based on a body-building premise Uh which to build muscle you needed to increase a large amount of protein to maintain that muscle,0.98,1.0
76,en-US,1264.1999872,15.170048,So you had to have protein on a regular basis throughout your day to sustain that image That person doesn't need it every day Person doesn't live that bodybuilding lifestyle So they don't have to have that nutritional consideration for the average person whether it's weight gain or weight loss or fitness or health,0.95,1.0
77,en-US,1279.6099583999999,13.8000384,Just Uh like Dr. Cole says it's it's about balance So to sustain a regular amount of good nutrition going in for me is a vital consideration versus Uh the damage that you're all going to be causing by having an excess amount of protein going in your system,0.95,1.0
