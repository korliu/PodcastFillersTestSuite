12,en-US,199.8500096,13.8599936,And it has been and also very sustainable Um much more sustainable than what I was doing at the time documentaries And it has been more sustainable And it's due to my own like you know lack of availability that it hasn't been more regular,1.0,1.0
13,en-US,214.10000639999998,22.8099968,And I'm glad to see that people have responded quite positively I know that a few people have actually approached James in person like hey You're James you man it wasn't anything nearly like that though I disagree completely because I've actually had several people that I know approached me and say hey you're on that podcast with James you,0.98,1.0
14,en-US,237.0899968,10.1100032,And these were women and men And for me it's kind of like I'm like yeah I'm on the podcast too Why are you not excited about me They're like do you know James who I'm like of course I know James,0.98,1.0
15,en-US,247.2,17.4599936,You know you're the sideshow Yeah And everybody they have this thing where they would always mention that Um you know like James doesn't talk as much as we'd like to hear James you a little more is like this fan base of women that says we want more James,0.97,1.0
16,en-US,264.6599936,17.279999999999998,And I'm like you know he was like the cowbell in this equation And I'm just like are you serious You want it You want more to hear the cowbell And I would agree with that Actually every time I hear someone say Uh we want to hear James speak more it's always been a woman,0.98,1.0
17,en-US,282.51000319999997,12.630016,And you know what Even I'm just going to lay it out there when I'm editing this podcast When James speaks it is by far the Uh most peaceful time during the recording and producing process for me when I speak,1.0,1.0
18,en-US,295.44,9.6699904,I just can't wait for it to be over And when Thomas speaks I need to turn up the volume When Chuck speaks actually pretty neutral But when James speaks I'm like OK I could do this for a few hours,0.99,1.0
19,en-US,305.1300096,13.04,I got the worst Like being neutral is like being neutered You're like no no Like being neutered It is It's like you don't matter either You want to like it means you are still talking It means you're low maintenance,0.98,1.0
20,en-US,318.1799936,14.790016,That's a good thing You want to evoke emotion You want to evoke I don't know A response No OK so now that we have evoked several responses from people who listen to us and we're very grateful Uh Where do you want to take this in 2017,1.0,1.0

22,en-US,344.4599808,9.900006399999999,I want to be more surgical with the topics we talk about And I'm having trouble figuring out how to do that I'm also you know not very experienced in terms of broadcasting So that's kind of an issue as well,1.0,1.0
23,en-US,354.3599872,10.550016,But I feel like we'll get there You know we're in our 11th episode and it's gone a lot farther than I think any of us thought it would Um Yes Have any things that you'd like us Uh to be doing in the next year,0.96,1.0
24,en-US,364.9200128,11.849984,More where The live stuff man Let's get together and eat I think we should be doing the live in the restaurant feeds Yeah Or it doesn't even have to be a feed We can actually do a you know podcast out of there,0.95,1.0
25,en-US,377.24999679999996,15.029990399999999,Right And and I think Uh something we should do that we should have like a rule like when when two of us are gathered or something like two or three or something like that where it doesn't because sometimes trying to manage all four of us getting together can be nearly impossible,0.98,1.0
26,en-US,392.4599808,10.2000128,Very so you know like I just think if Uh most of us are there or whatnot like just like just run with it you know Yeah As long as it's not like some the if it's two people it's fine,0.97,1.0
27,en-US,402.6599936,10.4400128,If there's a third person that's never been there before as long as they're not some weirdo or some racist or bigot or something like that I don't know You kind of look like direct Like what are you saying,0.97,1.0
28,en-US,413.1300096,12.4799744,Well I've just because I've responded to what you said Okay Right Uh It's not that you're a bigot I mean you're the weirdo Yeah Thanks Wow Hours tops the line for weirdness is probably Unai Chuck Yeah And it's like we're at we're at Chuck's place and I was,0.92,1.0
29,en-US,425.609984,12.7200256,And you feel like he's just getting hammered I know I know I need some more of this I like those ideas though you know doing Um more stuff at restaurants Uh We have a few friends that I'm sure would be willing to accommodate us,0.94,1.0
30,en-US,438.3300096,14.999961599999999,Right James you have any thoughts going forward towards twenty seventeen No I mean as far as I'm concerned I've enjoyed you know the episodes that we've done Um as far as footy call I think it's pretty much exactly what I had thought it was going to be,0.95,1.0
31,en-US,453.75001599999996,11.969996799999999,You know just a bunch of guys getting together just rapping about food and Um the live stuff Sounds great though I would definitely get into that a lot more I think I think those are a lot of fun Even if it's just a couple of us or three of us or whatever,0.98,1.0
32,en-US,465.7200128,15.6599808,You can always refer back to that particular live feed with food All right We have the four of us to get to talking about something And you can always just cut to that particular clip or something Yeah some of our best moments have been really off the cuff when we want to go eat dog meat,0.98,1.0
33,en-US,481.9800064,12.8799744,Uh That was very emotional for a lot of people or just kind of weird for for me Um But then when you produce the taco because it was a Tuesday YOUTU I think that was like I think it was only emotional for you if I'm perfectly honest,0.97,1.0
34,en-US,494.88,13.9500032,Yeah it was it was alienating and strange for me Um But anyway you can always refer back to that video I've also made available on YouTube So let's see more of that And maybe not dog though just going to say Mayeux samin dude,0.95,1.0
35,en-US,509.01002239999997,13.589964799999999,That was highlighted on 2068 I knew that was going to come out That's that's low life All right All right Let's that's the perfect Segway Let's transition into you We started in April and so I wasn't you know keeping my finger on the pulse,0.96,1.0
36,en-US,522.6699775999999,17.140019199999998,Of food and social media in Seoul Uh before that point But let's start with the lowlights here There's been a lot of stuff that's happened on social media a lot of restaurants I don't live up to expectation Um What are some lowlights that you can think of in terms of 2016 that will finish off on a high note,0.98,1.0
37,en-US,539.830016,15.1499776,I hope I hope Uh for me Some people just kind of being really antagonistic on social media was a very big lowlight for me because at the end of the day food you know I think I speak for all of us when I say that food should be bringing people together,0.99,1.0
38,en-US,555.4600448,13.9199488,And if you're coloring people's experience of food through just rhetoric or Um some sort of hate speech you know why do that Nobody likes that done to them And that's probably been the biggest lowlight for me I mean it's happened quite a bit though that's for sure,1.0,1.0
39,en-US,569.4099967999999,15.230003199999999,Right That's when I how expat life is or or if it hasn't happened quite as much maybe it's just happened more as of late maybe which is why it's sort of at the forefront But there have been you know a lot of instances I would say over the past couple of months or something,0.95,1.0
40,en-US,585.0399744,16.920064,Stuff like that So maybe that's why it's sort of right at the forefront Is it just me or does it seem like it's always kind of the same players involved Because I guess you know there's only a few there's a few thousand people in the biggest food Facebook group and there's probably about a hundred or so active,0.98,1.0
41,en-US,601.9600383999999,21.0599936,members Right Less like maybe three percent are active And of those three percent it's always kind of the same people that you know stir up trouble So Well wait wait No I just think it's funny because we probably have like like that side of the room is probably relatively active you know,0.98,1.0
42,en-US,623.049984,12.540057599999999,Yeah that's true These two guys are much more active than we are I'm not saying that in a bad way but you guys are part of that top two percent or whatever I mean OK so there's a group of what it's like 10000 members,0.97,1.0
43,en-US,635.5900416,20.489984,And if you figure there's about a hundred active and Sure then there are moments where we have been more active Thomas less so as of late than prior Uh And the same for me really I don't really post as much as as I used to but I try to stay out of this nastiness the drama the drama,0.98,1.0
44,en-US,656.6599679999999,17.6100352,Right Um It's a lot of fun to read if I'm perfectly honest Actually it is I've come to the conclusion that it's actually more fun to read than to participate Oh yeah that's that's why the other you know two thousand seven hundred three thousand members they just kind of read,0.99,1.0
45,en-US,674.2899712,15.1200256,Right Right But we get to comment threads that are over like 60 long Sure And it feels like at some point you just saturated read And at what point you know it's not like people are sitting back here and humoring someone who's Um being very hateful,0.96,1.0
46,en-US,689.7100287999999,18.3299584,They're calling B.S. You know they're like hey you're only interested in yourself or Um that didn't need to be said or you're not really advancing the discussion But that doesn't seem to matter You know doesn't go anywhere And I also think like recently the last I guess what three two or three months I guess,0.97,1.0
47,en-US,709.0399744,16.770048,The whole I guess Shake Shack and a lot guys and there's a lot of hatred towards both of them for the lines Why are people standing in line for this mediocre food Uh that doesn't meet our expectations And there's been a lot of post towards that,0.98,1.0
48,en-US,725.8100224,12.0300032,But if you take the food for what it is it's not terrible food I mean by any means It's the context It's the context of you know do I really want to sit there and wait two hours in line to get this food,1.0,1.0
49,en-US,738.1100031999999,17.6799744,And for me no but and but there's a lot of hatred towards these companies which I don't understand Why Because the lines are formed by the people in the line It's not like the company is going out there or paying people you know or not just giving people food in a timely manner,0.99,1.0
50,en-US,755.7899775999999,15.8900224,Right But I mean if you're waiting in line for two hours I think you end up developing a higher expectation of the food to justify that you spent two hours But I feel like a lot of the people that waited and waited in line for two three hours weren't disappointed with their experience for having waited,0.99,1.0
51,en-US,771.9799808,12.1000448,I feel like there's been a lot more Uh You know Um there's been a lot more What what what do you want to call it Like a backlash Yeah Backlash exactly From people sitting back watching the people wait in line,0.99,1.0
52,en-US,784.5200384,8.9999872,And those are the people like I can't believe you waited in line to I would never do that Well that's why you're not there Right You know it's like And at the end of the day you still haven't tried their burgers,0.99,1.0
53,en-US,793.5499775999999,14.6699776,Yes So really what do you have to comment on They want to stand in line Let them stand in line If you look at the constituency of people standing in line you know it's Um they're not I feel like it's disproportionately not that many like foreigners and foreigners,0.98,1.0
54,en-US,808.2199552,13.770035199999999,Are all the people talking about it Right But they're not the ones actually standing in line to insult the locals Yeah So you know I guess what what are you complaining about The Isaura it's not your time There was one thing I stood in line for in and out burger,0.94,1.0
55,en-US,822.7999744,15.990015999999999,Um I had no problems with that no complaints But you know 2016 was a year of a lot of lines We saw something interesting happen was Um the spotlight It shined so brightly and so intensely on certain businesses in certain months that these lines kind of formed and happened,0.98,1.0
56,en-US,838.7899904,14.550016,And then it fed into the atmosphere of social media It also brought up a lot of you know amazing places that I feel like without bias and maybe without Futi call Jassan Uh would not have done so well or would have Uh maybe not survived,0.94,1.0
57,en-US,853.6400384,19.079936,Right And it also kind of showed flaws in their processes Like some people like great experiences Some people had really inconsistent food They didn't come out in a timely manner Uh things like that So I think that was a double edged thing here where you know these businesses like some of our favorites Um just like we just had create,0.99,1.0
58,en-US,873.0800128,13.5000064,the cookies mix and malt is another one Um mix and malt It was a huge year for makes them all right So much so that they've essentially become a meme on ARBs Right Right And there is some backlash towards them for God knows what reason,0.93,1.0
59,en-US,886.6100223999999,13.799935999999999,Yeah Yeah It's gotten to the point where they can Uh their scrutiny certainly on them has become so intense that they cannot get away with even one Uh slightly you know just decent dish Everything has to be amazing Right And I think that's another thing too,0.98,1.0
60,en-US,900.4099583999999,14.4600064,It's like when you set those like when it's not like you set those expectations so high but it's one of those expectations are set that high for you that if anything deviates from that then you feel like you know if this were a place that were hardly ever talked about and someone went there and had an average,0.99,1.0
61,en-US,914.8699647999999,13.8000384,meal no one would ever hear about it you know and it would just fly under the radar But since it's like 99 people have said such good things about it and you had the one mediocre experience you feel compelled to go out and say hey I had a mediocre experience here,0.99,1.0
62,en-US,928.6700032,9.059942399999999,I don't know what the hell you guys are talking about And then of course that sparks the whole firestorm you know and it's just like a lot of that is just unnecessary 2016 is the year of the hype,0.98,1.0
63,en-US,937.9399679999999,18.1199872,It's just a lot of unnecessary silliness I mean as far as food goes I still feel like Korea is Uh at its infancy as far as like the development of food You know and for people that come from let's say if you want to call it more sophisticated food cultures and and just you know and just Bashan Korea,0.97,1.0
64,en-US,956.0599552,13.080064,like The one thing that I can't really stand is just like that a Korea hating you know it's like you come to a foreign country it provides your livelihood and you're going to sit there and you're going to sit there and bash on it for for a little things like that,0.96,1.0
65,en-US,969.2700672,11.119923199999999,OK South Korea the food here is not as good as the food that you had at home So what You know think about where it was a while ago when you couldn't even have that at all It's like you know you're starting to get more and more options,0.98,1.0
66,en-US,980.6900224,11.969945599999999,Give it some time And in the meantime you can have some amazing Koreans happier times Absolutely And I think a lot of that is sort of spilled over into I think the most dramatic example is with Michelin coming to Korea,0.95,1.0
67,en-US,992.6599679999999,13.950054399999999,Oh God Right You know this is Michelin's first year here Uh And are you hearing from the expert circles is almost none of it's positive And it's just like I don't feel that's really warranted either Granted there's there's probably a little bit of shadiness going on,0.96,1.0
68,en-US,1006.7600384,17.0099712,Sure But let's just say one Michelin first one to Japan Whenever it first went there I'm sure they didn't get every single restaurant that they could have possibly had They've had the benefit of being in the guide for so many years and having things added to it slowly to where now everyone's like oh it's now it's flushed,0.97,1.0
69,en-US,1023.7700096,11.3999872,out It's well and it's a very well respected sort of system But I'm just like what was it like the very first year they went there You know I can't imagine it was a whole lot different I'm sure there was a little bit of underhanded dealings there,0.98,1.0
70,en-US,1035.5899392,15.0900736,Right Because who do you how do you pick what first You know what first to put it in the guide Um Well over the years the whole thing with the underhanded business dealings with Michelin it is not only with Korea that there is underhanded or just shady,0.97,1.0
71,en-US,1051.369984,11.8199296,I mean it's happens in Europe It happens in America So it's not just Korea So I don't know why people are complaining about that aspect of it but nobody wants to recognize that They just want to be like oh you know when it came to Korea and look look at this,0.98,1.0
72,en-US,1063.1899136,14.7600384,Hey what do you know It was a joint venture with Sheila and hey what do you know Lione get three stars You know it's like I don't know how it is and the other countries as well But then don't you think in Korea it was very poorly done in at least from what I you know kind of,0.96,1.0
73,en-US,1077.949952,13.4099968,read and kind of saw It's like I don't think any of the three star restaurants were actual three star restaurants you know or they would even be in you know like I don't know I just I hold the candle up to their international or I mean it doesn't have to even be countercultural,0.96,1.0
74,en-US,1091.3599488,12.1800704,I just don't think they're even like I think those restaurants aren't even at a caliber that Koreans would be proud of Like I think that's the least you'd want I would say I think one of them is the other one isn't,0.99,1.0
75,en-US,1104.0799743999999,18.2100992,Right There are only two that made three stars Right Right And one of them that made three stars doesn't even it's not even Asia's top 50 type of restaurant It didn't even make that particular list So for that one restaurant to make it into that list you know and I've been there and it's not anything special actually,0.97,1.0
76,en-US,1122.2900736,13.5299072,I mean I've been to both but one of them really I would never go back to again The other one I have no problem eating it Um but no problem eating at is very different from like I mean giving it like two stars is OK giving it once,0.98,1.0
77,en-US,1136.3100672,12.9800192,But giving it three stars is like you're saying it's world class Like you got to come to this country to eat this food like And I just don't think and Um you know I think like you said there's a lot of good things and there's a lot of bad things about food in Korea,0.99,1.0
78,en-US,1149.6800256,13.139968,But I think Uh because for me I kind of fluctuate both ways Right And I feel those things as well because I'm very critical because I I have a restaurant so I'm like looking at the ingredients I'm like that's not quite you know like we don't have those ingredients that we need or different things like that,1.0,1.0
79,en-US,1162.8199935999999,12.1199616,I feel the pains But also I do see things getting better And I do talk to people who tell me the good and the bad And I am excited for you know the way that things are growing and kind of being in that mix,0.99,1.0
80,en-US,1174.9399552,16.9500672,But then it kind of Uh makes me feel sad To a degree when I hear like you know like when I hear about like you know restaurants getting stars that just I mean even if it's not even if it's not world class I would hope it's like oh this represents Korean food,0.99,1.0
81,en-US,1191.8900224,10.5900032,Well you know or like or to that to that degree maybe it's not as refined or they're not using some crazy techniques or whatever But you're like man this is this is kind of cool This is proud at least for Koreans,0.98,1.0
82,en-US,1202.4800255999999,10.979942399999999,And I think I think that's where I think I personally have an issue I think Yeah There could be the corruption that could be like this you know first time doing it So it's a little bit like not as perfect as everybody wants it to be,0.99,1.0
83,en-US,1213.6700928,15.8399488,But regardless of that I think I would want restaurants in there that people would be like man this is kind of cool I want to check out these restaurants And I think that's what it deviated from And I think that's where the biggest schism or you know at least for me personally when I when I saw the,0.98,1.0
84,en-US,1229.5100416,11.9100416,list and I kind of went through the stuff I was like I just don't know if I want to go to most of these restaurants because of the fact that you know Um you just felt like it wasn't really true to Korea,1.0,1.0
85,en-US,1242.3199743999999,8.4900864,I don't know I will say that I was surprised to see two three star restaurants in the guide I didn't expect to see any Yeah I expected most of them to be one star and maybe a couple of two stars,0.98,1.0
86,en-US,1250.8399616,15.6700672,Right Right And and I think if they did that they would have gotten a lot more respect And then It would have kind of built the road for hopefully you know because like I said I don't know how it was in Japan but even one star restaurants I went to in Japan I thought men some of them,0.99,1.0
87,en-US,1266.7800576,14.329958399999999,they're not fancy by any means You know they're just doing what they do but they're doing it with a certain philosophy and passion But Um I don't necessarily think A lot of the restaurants on the Korean Korean Korea list are operating necessarily that way,1.0,1.0
88,en-US,1281.4399488,13.1001344,I would be really interested to see how many of the let's say the original one star or two star restaurants from the very first year that guy came out Right Still have their stars right I'm sure there would be some but I would imagine a lot done,0.98,1.0
89,en-US,1294.9699584,16.5000192,But I would say that that's true of Um at as in like maintaining just that same star or elevating or going down I think that fluctuates a lot actually you know on the Michelin guy you know because actually in New York there's Restaurant Daniel which is owned by Uh Daniel Blue,0.95,1.0
90,en-US,1311.4999808,13.2900864,Well world class French chef and his restaurant which has always been a four star Uh New York Times restaurant in the city and one of the leading restaurants in the city actually got downgraded from three stars to two stars,0.98,1.0
91,en-US,1325.6300543999998,17.0399744,And when I see something like that and I just can't imagine that There are restaurants here in Korea that match that caliber of restaurant And so I have some suspicions about shady business you were talking about Pretty much,0.96,1.0
92,en-US,1342.9399552,11.480063999999999,So I wanted to ask this question I want I want everyone to pass judgment I'm going to abstain simply because I haven't even looked at the list Um But the fact that Michelin is here you know it came this year,0.98,1.0
93,en-US,1354.4300544,18.749952,And with respect to the list that has been provided for everyone Is this a positive thing that they're now here Is this a good jumping off point from which Uh that you know Seoul could not emulate like Tokyo or in Japan but go its own route to rise to international prominence you know in our own culinary cuisine,0.98,1.0
94,en-US,1373.1800064,15.1200768,Is it a positive thing It's a great thing It's a great thing says Thomas So I mean just the fact that Michelin would even come to Korea seems like basically says a lot about where Korea has advanced in the last 30 40 years,0.94,1.0
95,en-US,1388.6300159999998,16.189951999999998,And not just as You know basically as a society and with society comes with comes food I mean so but I think where Korea has come Um has a lot to do with like you know Uh I think Korea is becoming more of a destination,0.99,1.0
96,en-US,1405.060096,14.699929599999999,It's a place like I mean there's a reason why Coldplay never came here but they're coming Their first concert is 2017 and journey's coming as well for the first time Exactly So again I think there's a lot of things cultural but then for me misselling coming,0.95,1.0
97,en-US,1421.910016,9.840025599999999,Um I don't know I mean I think I think it's good but I don't think it's good right now I think it could get get get get better You know it has to start at some point Right Right So I think that's kind of what you guys are saying,0.98,1.0
98,en-US,1432.1999872,18.480025599999998,It is a starting point Don't be too quick to say it's going to be it might be crap now but it's not going be crap forever hopefully And hopefully it can only get better Yeah So yeah I mean that's kind of my disappointment with this year's selections was that there really is no traditional Korean restaurant that got,0.97,1.0
99,en-US,1451.7600255999998,14.009958399999999,investigated I guess Right right Right And I would like to see some of these places that have been open for the past 50 60 70 years I would like to see those places get you know at least reviewed at least or investigated at least,1.0,1.0
100,en-US,1465.8899967999998,13.590015999999999,Right And have the But I think a lot of the restaurants that got put up in the list this time they're almost like fufu restaurants that are trying to Yeah James looks like he has something to say here,0.98,1.0
101,en-US,1479.4800128,12.899942399999999,He's not Not really I think I think Michelin coming here did a couple of things One it sort of gives validation you know to the food scene since there's a lot of people that you know sort of live and die by the Michelin guide,0.98,1.0
102,en-US,1493.6999936,15.899955199999999,Um But I think a lot of the restaurants that you mentioned Thomism many of them made like the bib gourmand list Right Um And honestly I think that's actually a really good jumping off point to start to you know because you have a lot of the a thirty dollars and under meals there that are actually really good you know,0.97,1.0
103,en-US,1509.5999488,13.910015999999999,Korean style food So All right well then that has been the Michelin star guide Um to move us forward because a lot of the stuff the lowlights are people just want to revisit again And we've kind of Uh generally covered them in this past Uh 15 or so minutes,0.98,1.0
104,en-US,1523.5099648,12.9900544,But the highlights and Uh three come to mind for me I'm going to lay out here and we'll get to them you know each and do time But first one of the biggest one is is pop ups pop ups not new in 2016 by 2016,0.95,1.0
105,en-US,1536.8299519999998,15.9899648,They really garnered a lot of attention And they produced a lot of excellent things I mean Um Jameses pop up was like six months long or something like that I hope it comes back around again soon Um There was Sheft which eventually gave rise to help you know,0.94,1.0
106,en-US,1552.9100288,17.5799296,Exactly And that has been one of the biggest restaurants Uh talked about this year Actually it's one Uh of the most popular restaurant at this point I say that recording time right Yeah Right So there's been that as well I mean our good friend Jehad is a roast beef popper,0.91,1.0
107,en-US,1570.6700799999999,15.589887999999998,Right And that was amazing as well Um And then there's you know despite how you might feel about long lines and such but foreign food proliferation Right That's been a huge thing this year Uh We'll talk about that And also lastly rhetoric,0.99,1.0
108,en-US,1586.2700032,10.919936,There's a lot of people saying negative things but there's also a lot of people fighting back against that And I believe if you're at least talking about it in you're encouraging discussion then we're going to go somewhere you know and we are here on Foody Call,0.96,1.0
109,en-US,1597.609984,16.7399424,And Um what we did with Uh Sorachi sisters in the last episode Um are all ways to increase that rhetoric and kind of bring attention to the food scene and all these other issues that are involved with it Uh Any other highlights that come to mind or anything else Uh you want to dove deeper into within the three that I've just laid,0.99,1.0
110,en-US,1614.3499264,16.8399872,down guys Um I would say just Uh kind of going along with what you're saying is I think the standard of Uh you know like we can always criticize that the standard isn't where we want it And I think that may be true but then I think the standard has risen definitely you know,1.0,1.0
111,en-US,1631.4599423999998,20.070092799999998,So I spent you know whether we're talking about big you know conglomerate franchise chains coming to Korea or just Uh you know small restaurants popping up whether they're like little Vietnamese restaurants or Mexican restaurants or whatnot Um Like there's a lot of places I went this year you know like like all places everybody went to this year,0.97,1.0
112,en-US,1651.5600384,9.350041599999999,But you know like some of the best for like that I had even before this year was all stuff where people were like oh this is so good And I go and I'd be like I could tell this Uh broth was not made in house,0.95,1.0
113,en-US,1660.9200128,10.140057599999999,It was from a bag It was shipped here And then they're like how do you know And then I'm like just wait And I was like I sound like look they're going to bring the vaccine And they literally like brought the bag to refill this the soup,0.95,1.0
114,en-US,1671.36,11.9999488,And so for me just the fact that people are caring enough you know there are people who are trying to make better you know better for you know or whatever that looks like that standard has risen you know like once once,0.99,1.0
115,en-US,1683.9300096,9.7200128,Um I think standards are kind of like that where it's like once you try it it's hard to go back to certain things as well So you know I feel like people who are willing to you know push even Uh American style barbecue,1.0,1.0
116,en-US,1693.6600575999998,16.399974399999998,Right Whether we're talking about Linus Manimal or Sweet OK you know they're pushing the bar They're saying hey Uh you know don't go like don't go to places that don't care about like not doing food the right way And let's recognize that these places that are pushing the bar the standard they're all taking a huge risk because they're,0.97,1.0
117,en-US,1710.0600319999999,16.9499648,deviating far from what's acceptable And it is just difficult to do financially to acquire these ingredients or to do these time consuming techniques to prepare the food in this way Right So that takes a lot of Um I guess a lot of courage and a lot of Uh belief faith in what you're doing as well,0.99,1.0
118,en-US,1727.3700351999998,14.550016,Right And that's to all of our benefit Of course we've seen a lot of that this year like Uh we've seen a lot of Vietnam these places pop up Uh I feel like sort of like bond music have gotten more attention than before because there have always been few places here,0.91,1.0
119,en-US,1741.949952,9.3200384,Granted not all of them are good but this year it just seemed like every other week it was like a band Me play spun me place by me place Um And then of course they always have the fight there,0.93,1.0
120,en-US,1751.6998655999998,13.880115199999999,And we also had a lot of barbecue places open up this year that They just weren't very successful at it I would imagine Um And I can think of a bunch that opened up I can't think of a bunch that really lasted or a bunch that are talked about as being any good,0.98,1.0
121,en-US,1765.76,19.8199296,Yeah Like just within this neighborhood that we're in Up young bedan and around the corner towards the Itaewon there's the main ones that most people know about You know there's Uh linos and there's Manimal And then there's the other ones Um that are almost never talked about in terms of Schmiel I think like LoCo's Unnamable I can't even remember,0.95,1.0
122,en-US,1785.5899648,16.2101248,And like the other one is a rusty rusty Uh kimochi Tinder's kinders around the corner right near Caggiano Street Um I've tried that plays out as well And there's another big one in Italian that I don't even remember That's the one that's on the far end pass Hamilton,0.89,1.0
123,en-US,1801.8500608,17.2197888,That's what I'm saying I don't even remember the name but a bunch of those I put them in the poser category personally like as in you know I think they're like hey this is hot They're on restaurants And I've had Um you know I've had people tell me they're like hey I went here because there was a lot,0.96,1.0
124,en-US,1819.0698496,14.0101632,of social media and a lot of buzz about it And they're like that's all it was It was social media and buzz And especially because a lot of these you know a lot of these restaurants are targeting Korean people natives that haven't had international experience,0.99,1.0
125,en-US,1833.2700671999999,12.499967999999999,So and they're just going to you know but the Koreans are the ones that told me how bad it was compared to the places that we mentioned where they go And they're like I thought this was going to be the same thing or something similar but it wasn't,0.99,1.0
126,en-US,1846.2500863999999,10.779852799999999,And I think that's how it has been for a lot of places that I mean even for us we do burrito bowls And most recently there are two or three places in this neighborhood that started doing burrito bowls,0.99,1.0
127,en-US,1857.0500095999998,15.960064,No seriously Yeah it's it's like not even funny But if you look at the pictures you're like okay they just Uh poured some cankered in there like literally just dripped it directly from the can And you know they it's not even it doesn't even look it doesn't pass the test for me you know,0.95,1.0
128,en-US,1873.4000128,8.6401024,So I mean if it does then I kind of want to check it out just see how they're doing you know see if it tastes right But I'm not even going to check them out You know don't support these restaurants,0.99,1.0
129,en-US,1882.3999488,19.230105599999998,People the ones that are you know lower people's standards Uh unless they're charging a proportionate amount for that lessoned divorce rate then that's fine If they're not charging anywhere near that that price then you can't compare But I know for me like I were in Chaly Kitchen I can't even remember the last time I had a burger here,0.96,1.0
130,en-US,1901.6300543999998,13.050060799999999,because I've been eating burrito bowls almost like nonstop And I really really enjoy it here Right It's gotten to the point where you know I know what the burger tastes like but I just Um it's like going to Panda Express and not getting orange chicken for me,0.97,1.0
131,en-US,1914.7700224,10.2899712,You know you have to you So ah for you it's like going to a sushi place and not getting a southaven with a bunch of minutes on it Right Because we all know sushi You know I like I got mail,0.93,1.0
132,en-US,1925.32992,14.970060799999999,His restaurant a compliment And he's just going to like throw it back in my face And I appreciate the compliment I appreciate the compliment All right So foreign food Um definitely getting up there which I'm glad to see Hopefully that'll rise in 2017 as well,0.96,1.0
133,en-US,1940.2999808,14.7300352,And we'll see Uh the restaurants that are people just kind of jumping on the bandwagon opening up very similar restaurants Um I like to see that go by the wayside I like to see you know trends kind of go the way that trends should go,1.0,1.0
134,en-US,1955.84,15.600025599999999,I'm just going to say that St. Charles doesn't have the same crazy line that actually obstructs traffic anymore that he used to have Now it has business worthy of a corner churro stand Moving on to Uh a slightly different tangent here,0.97,1.0
135,en-US,1972.2999808,14.680064,Uh Halaal guys got to try out a bunch of times Thank you very much James And I think it's a great thing Those are like two huge changes that have actually made it sort of out out their way to Korea not like you know like your fast casual diners,0.96,1.0
136,en-US,1986.9900799999998,11.3598464,It's much it's a different thing than when Taco Bell came For sure Or orwin like Bennigan's or TGI Fridays or stuff like that You know those are really big food conglomerates that just plunk down their casual restaurants here,0.99,1.0
137,en-US,1998.3499264,11.910143999999999,But these are like you know they started very small They grew really big over there And now they're starting their international expansion Um I think it's good to see like Shake Shack and hire guys here I haven't tried hard guys ever,0.97,1.0
138,en-US,2010.7399168,19.1100928,And I Um other than here And I've never tried Shake Shack either here or in America because it's not in the West Coast Um People are saying you know it doesn't stack up Uh in terms of Shake Shack Um I think it's very very close to the ones in New York that I've eaten that,0.98,1.0
139,en-US,2029.9399168,15.450111999999999,Not identical but very close You know Uh compensated for regional you know differences in terms of ingredients Pricing is almost identical if you take into that if you take into account the exchange rate So it's good to know Um I think it's a great thing that they're here,0.97,1.0
140,en-US,2045.4201343999998,13.64992,I mean it's only going to further the food scene here You know whether even if it is fast food I mean it doesn't matter But just their presence here I think will attract even other companies to come here as well,1.0,1.0
141,en-US,2059.0700544,13.8000384,So Right You know hopefully I doubt it very seriously but hopefully you know eaten in and out You know they should look at the Uh success you know success and basically say hmm maybe we should go So but they won't in and out,0.96,1.0
142,en-US,2072.8799232,12.019916799999999,Well no they won't Are there still lines at Shake Shack Uh Uh very little Right OK Like I feel like I get maybe 20 people at the most OK I could get a meal within like an hour or be in and out,0.9,1.0

145,en-US,2107.899904,14.430207999999999,2016 has been the year in which I kind of like made a return to not eating green because I always like been doing that since I came here but I started really appreciating it again And I think that for foreigners it's easy to take that Uh for granted,0.99,1.0
146,en-US,2122.4800256,14.340095999999999,Oh that will always be there because yes it will always be there But that doesn't mean that you can't appreciate it when you're searching for all these other foods and you're keeping your Uh finger on the obvious pulse of what's trendy and like oh I got to try this one place or Um I'm going to go line up for,0.97,1.0
