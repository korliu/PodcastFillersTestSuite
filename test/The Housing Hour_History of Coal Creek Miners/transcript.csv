49,en-US,781.0100223999999,23.1499264,And instead of spending money incarcerating these criminals they would actually make money off of them Well that was a kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy there If you're making money instead of spending money you want more And so as a result they began to increase the population of prisons in the states by passing numerous new laws,0.99,1.0
50,en-US,804.64,16.5000192,And Alex Haley who's the Ilford routes used to live in Anderson County I had the Madames County back in the 80s I had the pleasure to go out and interview him for a local newspaper back when he was out there to we farm and we got to talking about the kombiglyze system,0.94,1.0
51,en-US,821.4399999999999,15.7299712,He point out he said Convict leasing the is that you've got to understand its relation to Jim Crow the Jim Crow laws are always looked at by historians as racist laws that were passed in the south said they were racist in their intent,0.95,1.0
52,en-US,837.6200192,19.919974399999997,I mean in effect But their intent was was commercial or content was economic They were created to increase the population in prisons that would then be leased out private industry and make more profits to the states And that's exactly what they did and the south being what it was,0.99,1.0
53,en-US,857.929984,17.5200768,Most of those laws were aimed at the population of former slaves and Uh the so they became known as Jim Crow because so many of them were racially involved But some of them did They make their voice They had to do with taking simple crimes such as petty theft had been 30 days in jail and increasing it to,0.97,1.0
54,en-US,875.4500608,13.2599808,a one year prison term because a little owls wouldn't allow the cutting The companies didn't want to release a Um convict for 30 days that took them that long to train them They want a year out of them So they had to be guaranteed a year before they release them,0.92,1.0
55,en-US,889.0399744,14.4600064,So they increased the penalty on a lot of minor crimes Uh As a result the population of convicts in the Tennessee system after the Civil War there were 200 criminals in the Tennessee prison system but 18 nannies or 5500,0.92,1.0
56,en-US,904.0700416,16.049971199999998,The population of white prisoners in 1865 was two hundred The population of white prisoners in 1892 was two hundred Hmm Like give you an idea what happened It was in another word it was the extension of the institution of slavery by another name,0.91,1.0
57,en-US,920.5699583999999,10.3800832,And it wasn't just in Tennessee It was all over the south In Mississippi they released them out to cotton planters and Tennessee to the coal mines in Georgia and the Carolinas They leased them out to the textile mills,0.94,1.0
58,en-US,931.3099775999999,17.4000128,But every southern state instituted to convict system except Kentucky They backed off Of course they weren't a Confederate state You know remember they stayed in the union and they backed away from it A convict lease really didn't get started though and in the tail,0.95,1.0
59,en-US,949.6899583999999,13.2299776,Coal is being man commercially There are no commercial coal mines in East Tennessee at all At the end of the Civil War they knew coal was there There'd been the coal creek for instance the town of coal Great,0.92,1.0
60,en-US,963.3399807999999,8.5799936,Got its name from a creek that ran out of the mountains It was named because of all the coal that they found in the sediments in the bottom the creek Uh There was no commercial way to get it out,0.97,1.0
61,en-US,972.2200064,13.5300096,After the Civil War a bunch of entrepreneurs built a railroad out from Knoxville to the nearest place where coal could be mine And that happened to be where the creek ran a kind of a gap through the ridge out of them a couple of mountains in the valley,0.91,1.0
62,en-US,986.2299648,19.4100224,And you know they built a little town There is the railroad reached there You know in 1868 there was nothing listed 1869 Bradstreet business listings They had the town of Coal Creek Atwill businesses It was the livery stable a coal company a bank and six Uh saloons,0.91,1.0

64,en-US,1016.7100416,13.6799232,Uh So there were nobody nobody around here knew how to man Colo And the companies that another challenge because they couldn't find anybody to man to coal So they went up north and they recruited Welsch matters out of Pennsylvania Foyles immigrants that had experience,0.88,0.99
65,en-US,1030.7500032,14.2900224,They went into up to New York and got them right off the boats And they brought all these Welsch Uh experience Wells matters down to Cold Creek to to Uh start the first line into NOx Iron Company which was there in Knoxville,0.91,0.99
66,en-US,1045.479936,20.460031999999998,The old foundry that smelled the town up so bad that ah the middle of town before they they tore it down a number of years ago that the Knoxville Iron Company they needed coal to fuel their furnaces And so they they opened the first mine and Um they worked those Willsch miners Uh who came in,0.94,1.0
67,en-US,1065.939968,13.7100288,And then they provide them with a Uh job And they've managed to find some places to live and everything And they went along just fine till 1876 And there was a little bit of a recession And the company dropped wages and the matters went on strike,0.95,1.0
68,en-US,1080.6899712,19.1100928,And then the Knox Island Company Uh turned to a coal company down in Tracy City Tennessee which had been using convicts since the get go since the early 1960s And they subleased convicts from from Uh that company and brought them in to replace the miners,0.95,1.0
69,en-US,1099.800064,14.459904,Late older Welsh miners all replace them with convicts Well that first time that that happened in 1876 didn't start people up too bad because there were a lot of other mines around that were still working Three labor miners were able to go get ohto jobs,0.93,1.0
70,en-US,1114.9499392,19.3900544,The ones that had struck the Knox own company man And a lot of those Pennsylvania Welchman they just went back home where they came from They said well they don't appreciate us down here We'll go home Uh So the next 15 years convicts were allowed to work in that one man and that one man only all the rest,0.95,1.0
71,en-US,1134.3499264,16.719974399999998,the man in the Coal Creek area We're all we're all being operated by Uh free miners And like the nanny one in 1891 all the company up Briceville Um had a Uh head of strike Its miners were having some labor problems with them,0.92,0.98
72,en-US,1151.4899456,20.099993599999998,And so the company decided to Um lay all the matters off and replace them with convicts Bodleian a few things had changed These miners were living in company houses The company had built a cable company called Tennessee Camp up in the lap of the mountains and they were running these miners their homes,0.95,1.0
73,en-US,1172.0699904,11.7599232,So the first thing that the company did when the convicts were brought in was Tell them your first job is to go and evict those miners families out of those houses and tear the houses down you're going to use the lumber to build your stockade,0.97,1.0
74,en-US,1184.6999039999998,17.0300416,And that was just going a little too far is what they did lose their job to come back Because another thing they have convicts come in and evict your family you know out of the house So the matter's all got together that evening in Uh mid-July and Uh met and said well we're going to do about it,0.94,1.0

76,en-US,1213.1800064,13.5499776,So they they didn't release them really They marched to convicts under guard down the railroad track to the depot load them on a train gave the guards back their guns and sent them all the Knoxville's that the governor telegram said don't send in more complex out here,0.93,0.99
77,en-US,1226.7299839999998,16.859955199999998,We don't want to Uh And the governor's response was to come out himself to address the matters and to admonish him to obey the law You know to not not this is not been 1891 maybe 91 And he Uh then he admonished the miners and he brought the back his words up,0.9,1.0
78,en-US,1243.5899392,12.8001024,He brought three companies a militia a little way OK So he was bringing a little strength with him at all strength And Um after he had his say he left convicts at the mines in the stockade with the militia guarding them,0.92,1.0
