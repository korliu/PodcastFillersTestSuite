0,en-US,6.9799999999999995,14.209999999999999,The Golfing Union of Ireland podcast Hello and welcome to the goofy podcast Alan Chaly here again with you It's been a while since our last episode but while back today with the chief executive of the Golfing Union of Ireland Pat Finn joins me in studio,0.95,1.0
1,en-US,21.2,11.85,Pat how are you I'm really well thank you Good It's been a year since we sat down and recorded our last lengthy interview And once again this year we've taken questions submitted on social media And I'm going to put some of those to you later,1.0,1.0
2,en-US,33.23,18.36,But first how was 2017 for the guy in golf in general Uh I think it was probably a mixed year Um on the golf course which is I suppose the main thing we do in terms of you know organizing international matches and Uh for players to go overseas to play in tournaments as as members of squads,0.97,1.0
3,en-US,51.589999999999996,17.0700064,We had a a mixed bag won the home internationals which are super the European Seniors Team Championship another brilliant performance from our our Um seniors players Um but not so many good individual performances or exceptional individual performances as we've become used to over the last number of years,0.96,1.0
4,en-US,68.66999679999999,15.080006399999998,So we're probably on the performance side just dealing with a period where we don't have the same number or the same riches of top class amateur players as we have enjoyed over the past decade or so And that's not to say that the players aren't there at the moment aren't good,0.99,1.0
5,en-US,83.7500032,13.44,They're they're very good Um But we just had enjoyed Um a really exceptional period over the last decade or so So yeah mixed bag And then for golf generally I think similarly clubs are still struggling with membership and Uh income and so on,0.99,1.0
6,en-US,97.94,16.38,Um A number of clubs closed during the year So you know it's a difficult time I think for golf Um in that regard But yes Um uh Uh we still have massive participation numbers in comparison to other sports and Um there's a good base there to to work from once once the thing starts to turn around,0.99,1.0
7,en-US,114.8,15.719999999999999,You mentioned individual success It's been quite a year for some of the guys that have left the amateur ranks and moved into the pro game in the Uh under the the watchful eye of Team Ireland golf And I'm talking in particular of Gavin Moynihan who Uh managed to Uh achieve some wonderful things during the year,0.98,1.0
8,en-US,130.76,16.3500032,Yeah Gavin had a great year Um He's part of a a program that the CGI Wran's called Team Ireland to support the the the young professionals male and female Um that have just turned pro Uh in their first maybe half dozen years or so as professionals,0.95,1.0
9,en-US,147.1100032,21.0299904,So Um Garbin was the recipient of Um some Um Uh Uh Um benefits from that in terms of starts and and a cash grant Uh And he used a really well Um he he he's managed to secure Um a European tour card for next year and Uh practically and Uh obviously for the Chinese tour rights and so on,0.96,1.0
10,en-US,168.1399936,13.1100032,If he if he goes back that way But he looks set Uh to Uh propel through the European tour with a number of stars he's going to get on that and hopefully secure his full card and that Um in 2018 for 2019 and beyond,0.97,1.0
11,en-US,181.2499968,13.889996799999999,And then pulled on obviously is Uh on a different level completely to the five guys who Um who are the four other guys who he played Walker cope with in that special year Uh And he's he's really launched his career in a in a magnificent way,0.94,1.0
12,en-US,195.5899904,11.7000064,Cormick Schavan another one of those had a great year on the on the Challenge tour and had secured a full Chinese tour card for next year So he's on the way up as well So yeah there's been some some good successes there on the on the professional side,0.97,1.0
13,en-US,207.8600064,22.3499904,You mentioned golf clubs and some of the struggles that clubs are still facing out there a very challenging environment What work has the guy undertaken in the area of club services over the past year to help clubs Yeah well together with the Ilja you Um and the PGA Uh the GeoEye through CGI supports clubs and in Uh in various ways,0.96,1.0
14,en-US,230.2099968,12.1799936,We've done a lot of work over the last 12 months in the area of governance Uh trying to improve improve club's governance so that they're they're they're in a position to make decisions to to determine the future strategy of the club,0.98,1.0
15,en-US,242.3899904,22.289996799999997,So things like governance and strategic planning Um Um business planning are areas where we focused on on the last 12 months And we've helped a small number of clubs in a very significant way in that regard One of the ways in which the CGI has assisted clubs over the past year Uh has been in the preparation of Uh sports capital funding,0.98,1.0
16,en-US,264.67998719999997,20.3699968,applications 66 clubs and facilities supported this year Uh It's a good start Yeah well I mean it's up from I think around the maybe half dozen clubs I'm not sure the exact number Uh who got around 300000 in support Um the previous round of funding,0.99,1.0
17,en-US,286.1299968,20.430003199999998,Uh Yeah I think we're headed in the right direction Um Uh You know it's a pretty significant achievement to Um to reduce or to increase funding from 300000 to almost two million Uh from one cycle to the next And Uh you know we'd like to see that obviously increasing further Uh in the future as more clubs become aware that this type of support is,0.99,1.0
18,en-US,306.56,18.4699904,there The main issue in the past hasn't so much been that Um the sports capital fund hasn't supported golf It's that golf hasn't really applied Uh That's the main I know that you know there are other factors in terms of you know golf being seen as a wealthy sport and not needing the support and different things like that,0.98,1.0
19,en-US,325.03999999999996,19.079987199999998,But the the primary reason that we haven't benefited from the funding in the past is because golf clubs either didn't apply in numbers or as submitted Um invalid applications So we yeah we had a very significant awareness campaign earlier in the year and we supported clubs in making applications to ensure they weren't invalid,0.97,1.0
20,en-US,344.9200128,12.990003199999999,Um I think as more clubs become aware in the Republic of Ireland of the support Um more will apply and there'll be more funding available The CGI ciggies strategic plan we're about halfway through that I think it runs up to about 2020,0.95,1.0
21,en-US,358.489984,17.8200064,Uh One of the key things that have been delivered upon in that to date Well I guess starting from a from a standing start in 2013 when we launched CGI Um we've come a long way We Uh in the last 12 months we supported around 120 clubs and running get into golf programs,0.99,1.0
22,en-US,376.3099904,15.299993599999999,We worked with about 40 to 50 clubs in the area of business support Those areas I mentioned earlier Um governance Uh strategic planning and so on Um The Team Ireland program we spoke about just now is part of the CGI suite of services,0.99,1.0
23,en-US,391.910016,22.6799872,Um So that's another area of success Um We commissioned to exceptional pieces of research Uh participation study that the ISI helped us with Um and an economic impact study for golf that the the Sheffield Hallam University conducted for us Um And those two pieces of research really form a basis from which we can kind of Uh make decisions in the future,0.98,1.0
24,en-US,414.67998719999997,14.8399872,Understanding the the market better is is absolutely critical So for example the Sheffield Hallam piece of research on the economic impact that's something that no doubt will have helped us in chatting with Um the department and politicians and trying to improve golf a lot,0.97,1.0
25,en-US,429.53000959999997,12.0300032,You know that they understand the impact it's having Uh in the country So Uh yeah we've we've done a lot of CGI in in a pretty short space of time Um And Uh yeah intend on doing a significant amount more in the future,0.98,1.0
26,en-US,441.7200128,17.389977599999998,And what should we see in the area of club services in 2018 and beyond What are the developments like for that I think it's certainly more of the same Um More support to clubs that want to improve their governance that want to produce strategic plans Um but also a bit more research,0.99,1.0
27,en-US,459.1199744,18.980044799999998,I think we need to understand our market even more and Um to understand the reasons that people are deciding not to be members of golf clubs Uh or not to play golf even if they're not members There's a drop off in both the membership and participation very significant talking about a three percent drop in each of those Uh areas,0.98,1.0
28,en-US,478.10001919999996,19.4999808,And it's really to try and understand that better So we will commission research to try and understand whether it's time money Uh societal change as family changes what it is that actually is Uh resulting in people choosing not to be members are not to play golf and then helping focusing on a small number of golf clubs and helping them,0.98,1.0
29,en-US,497.59999999999997,19.2,to introduce strategies to try and tackle Uh whatever it is that that is is making people's minds up Um Uh or helping people to make their minds up So Uh it'll be picking a few few clubs focusing really strongly on them and trying to make them Um best practice models for Uh a wider rollout,0.98,1.0
30,en-US,517.1599871999999,12.060006399999999,That's the that's the plan not necessarily over the next year which was the question but the next couple of years The Jujuy podcast is sponsored by the GOP National Golf Academy located in the grounds of Cotton House Maynooth in County Kildare,0.96,1.0
31,en-US,529.5200255999999,15.059968,The academy is open to all with five USGA specification greens excellent target greens on tee boxes The Academy also offers a range of golf clinics and lessons Check them out of better golf daily or find them on Facebook and Twitter,0.96,1.0
32,en-US,544.6099968,16.2300416,You mentioned governance in the past couple of years The guy you're seeing some important changes within the establishment of a board which replaced the old executive committee and the decision taken at our last AGM to bring clubs into that fold and to vote on matters relating to the union's constitution,0.98,1.0
33,en-US,560.8699904,21.7700352,Why are these changes important and why should people care Yeah just The board replaced the old executive committee The executive committee was made up entirely of volunteers From within the organization so far within the you know the union officers and the branches of the organization the four provincial councils Uh whereas the board has got some external recruits including,0.97,1.0
34,en-US,582.6400256,18.9299712,the chairperson and two other members And that just gives I suppose a wider experience and knowledge base to the group Um as a more diverse group Uh of people sitting around the table which Uh helps to to Um help in the decision making process and strategic planning and so on,0.99,1.0
35,en-US,602.56,13.450035199999999,Um Clubs attending the AGM is probably the obvious one You know there's the old fashioned central council model where representatives of the provincial councils who were in charge and representatives of the clubs attended the Um the annual general meeting but the clubs themselves didn't,0.96,1.0
36,en-US,616.0300543999999,25.789952,And Um when we when we Uh were Um designing or devising our strategic plan several years ago we asked the clubs the question and they said unequivocally we want to attend So Um it just helps in the whole openness and transparency Um And I suppose Uh we should hopefully Um uh Uh ensure that clubs feel more connected with the organization than maybe they did before,0.98,1.0
37,en-US,641.8300416,12.689971199999999,Now coming back to the Confederation the CGI has been busy with get into golf programs And I suppose looking at it from the outside in they've probably been predominantly targeted at women and children over the past few years,0.99,1.0
38,en-US,654.8199936,18.0000256,They seem to have had a lot of success with these programs But what's going to be done to get more men into the game and indeed back into the game Yeah it's a tricky one because the structured programs to get men and boys Uh but more so men into the game Um are Uh you know they haven't been a success,0.97,1.0
39,en-US,672.9599999999999,16.1499648,We've run them Um but they just haven't haven't been as successful as the as the girls and women's programs Um which have been longer standing and longer running Um and have been really successful in conversion to membership and getting more people playing in the clubs that have that have run them,0.97,1.0
40,en-US,690.070016,23.3399808,Um It's difficult to nail down why that's the case Um Uh Some of it has to do with you know men's Um Um what's the best way of putting it Um Reluctance to get involved in a group training type Um scenario and more of it is down to the uh the requite and the women's and girls programs,0.99,1.0
41,en-US,713.4099967999999,15.5699712,There's a very significant volunteer effort involved in running them So the club has to engage heavily and as Reliant relies heavily on the volunteers to run the programs And there doesn't seem to be the same level of engagement on the men's side I guess Uh the men's programs up and running,0.99,1.0
42,en-US,729.3400064,9.930035199999999,So it's it's a really tricky one Um and we haven't cracked that Not yet But Uh we've more you know we're going to try out a few more things this year to see whether we can get closer to solving that problem,0.99,1.0
43,en-US,739.9600128,15.000012799999999,One of the things that the Uh Israeli report highlighted was the need for clubs to become more family friendly and family orientated and to provide a a wider range of services Is that something that the CGI will be Uh encouraging clubs to do over the next couple of years,0.98,1.0
44,en-US,755.219968,13.030041599999999,Yeah I think Um I mentioned earlier and understanding the market better and that's something we really need to try and understand so we can go with you know evidence that Um a more family friendly environment will result in more membership,1.0,1.0
45,en-US,768.2500096,22.3699968,And we've a lot of work to do to get to that point And it's not going to happen in the short term Um But yeah if you just take a look around at the changes in society Um the demands on people's time and Uh you know if if if if the golf club could become more family friendly environment where mom,0.98,1.0
46,en-US,790.6299904,21.3300224,dad and the children can go and play a four ball and they'll meet friends at the golf club Uh environment then time almost doesn't matter In fact the time question becomes almost an advantage The fact that golf takes four hours Um is suddenly an advantage because it's four hours of quality family time in a in a natural environment,1.0,1.0
47,en-US,812.7699968,17.279999999999998,Uh Yeah I was in fresh air and getting exercise So Um now I have to stress that that that won't be the solution for every golf club You know clearly Thura golf clubs in more densely populated areas that are thriving and don't need to introduce this kind of a model in order Um to survive,0.98,1.0
48,en-US,830.4699903999999,23.909990399999998,Um But your typical rural Um Uh club golf club community type golf club Um adopting a more family friendly Um atmosphere Um Uh I Uh you know just thinking about it I have to think that has to result in success Uh But it requires a massive cultural shift in the club Um among the existing members to say we're happy with our golf club becoming that kind of,0.98,1.0
49,en-US,854.3799808,13.260031999999999,an environment And that's that's really a shift that that we're going to have to show case studies and examples of this working so that we can bring people on that journey with us Um So that's a that's a medium term play,0.99,1.0
50,en-US,868.329984,18.3499776,Um But we're Foch CGI When I talk about the we it's CGI is focused On on trying to prove in the first instance understanding the market and then picking clubs and using them as case studies and proving that that model will work Uh rather than just saying we think it might work do clubs need to do more to tell,0.98,1.0
51,en-US,886.6799616,15.4500096,their own story you know as opposed to simply advertising membership at a certain price and hoping the people are just going to write a check or pay by debit card and sign up You know is is golf competing effectively against other sports like running cycling and and so on,0.99,1.0
52,en-US,903.6900352,23.5799552,Uh Um I think it's that's a tricky question to answer Um I think I think the offering of membership of a golf club Um There's there's much more involved in the offering than playing golf And Um sometimes that story isn't told So you'll have people saying oh you know it's much it's much better value just to Um play green fees,0.98,1.0
53,en-US,927.2899583999999,19.1100928,I don't need to be a member of the club But that's that's kind of ignoring the other benefits of being a member of a golf club And I think sometimes maybe golf clubs could Um do a better job Uh of highlighting Uh the benefits of membership over and above just the golf side of us or the competitions or the intercloud,0.99,1.0
54,en-US,946.4000512,13.8599424,golf or whatever Um And Uh so in that regard I think maybe golf clubs could do better But that's Uh you know at the same time you're Uh you Um you look at the work the clubs are doing to try and get more people into the game,0.98,1.0
55,en-US,960.2599935999999,16.2700288,And Um it's not that they're doing nothing You know it's not an easy sale in today's society where Um people are time poor maybe don't have the same level of disposable income as 10 years ago Um and have the family commitments we spoke about earlier,0.99,1.0
56,en-US,976.5499904,12.989951999999999,But yeah I think a little bit more could be done to try and Uh Um Uh Uh promote or make people aware of the wider benefits of golf and membership We said we take some questions from social media and we have a selection of them,0.98,1.0
57,en-US,989.5399424,16.1700864,Here am Tony O'Neill on Facebook Uh He said when are the guy going to join with local authorities and build driving ranges Kids getting into golf is difficult and we need more of these facilities Strategic plan perhaps of building a 100 range is in the next 10 years,0.95,1.0
58,en-US,1005.7199615999999,21.3499904,Should we put in place it would bring golf to the masses Is that not a great idea Can the guy not make that happen Um Well interestingly we used to Uh engage with Um councils in terms of building golf facilities so there are many public golf courses out there the gooi Um provided funding and loans for and so on,0.98,1.0
59,en-US,1027.0799872,10.950041599999999,So there's a history of doing it but we haven't done it for a long time Uh It is a really good point I don't think driving changes is the answer Personally Um hitting a golf ball and a driving range is not golf in my opinion,0.96,1.0
60,en-US,1038.5400832,22.0798976,Um It's not golf as we all know and love it at least Um Uh But there's something around that that model working with Um with local councils in building you know shorter facilities Um facilities that are easier for Um beginner golfers Uh to get to know how to play the game,0.99,1.0
61,en-US,1060.6199808,23.100006399999998,You know Um pitch and potters provide a decent enough route to a golf club membership Uh or to to to to becoming a golfer Um But I think we could do more to try and have more facilities Um in towns and cities that are Uh more accessible and maybe don't have the same Um rules and regulations apply to them and so on and,0.96,1.0
62,en-US,1083.7199871999999,10.1399552,that people can just go out and try and learn how to how to play a short course facilities as opposed to driving ranges How can that be progress Uh Will a guy need to engage CGI to to look at this,0.95,1.0
63,en-US,1094.6100224,18.0299776,Yeah it's it's not currently part of Um our strategic plan to to do a piece of work like this Um But you know Tony suggestion I think is a good one And Um you know it's a to take it to the next steps,0.97,1.0
64,en-US,1112.8800256,21.479936,I guess it is probably a matter for for CGI or perhaps Um the new governing body for golf Um which will be launched sometime over the next couple of years Also on Facebook Um just a comment from Kay Woods I'd like to show to a number of lady volunteers and dukes who have just helped get 42 new ladies complete their,0.97,1.0
65,en-US,1134.3599616,12.6000128,second year of the get into golf program A good number have become full members and the majority have their handicap This is a wonderful initiative and Duke's ladies are thrilled to have these new golfers join their club It takes time and effort to introduce new members but it's so worth it,0.99,1.0
66,en-US,1147.2,12.3899904,Thanks to all the volunteers and welldone for introducing the program We alluded to it earlier Volunteers play a huge part in the game What do you say to those that don't volunteer And how would you what would you how would you encourage them to get more involved,0.99,1.0
67,en-US,1161.1500544,16.919859199999998,Um Yeah well firstly on the Um on Duke's it's an example like the one we spoke about a bit ago and cares right I mean it's it's a massive effort a really good program and success for for Duke So well done to Duke's and all the clubs out there running such programs Um Uh to people not volunteering,0.97,1.0
68,en-US,1178.0699135999998,18.9901824,You know it's it's obviously difficult because it takes time to volunteer But if you do have time Um some spare time Uh I think there's an awful lot of satisfaction to be got out of volunteering You know if we go from club to club running tournaments we rely on a local suite of volunteers to to Um administer different aspects of,0.99,1.0
69,en-US,1197.060096,15.1798784,the tournament for us And Uh you can see when you kind of have a good tournament at the end of the week how Um how happy people are to have been part of that And Uh the volunteering brings a satisfaction I think,1.0,1.0
70,en-US,1212.2500095999999,17.209958399999998,And Um without volunteers the guy the Ilja Uh Uh CGI couldn't do what we do Or golf clubs or golf clubs for that matter Yeah Um of course Yeah So so we need volunteers Um and yeah there's a you know charging to to GeoEye volunteers,0.97,1.0
71,en-US,1229.459968,11.920076799999999,There's a great level of satisfaction out of it They like doing it That's why they do it Um And they also love the sport and want to give something to the sport Um Uh So it's tricky But yeah if you have the time try it out,0.99,1.0
72,en-US,1241.8499583999999,14.5801216,You know there's no harm in Uh in starting at a at a you know a tournament that might be run at your club by the GeoEye or Ilja you and seeing how you got on with that Uh and then progressing progressing through the different responsibilities,0.94,1.0
73,en-US,1256.7600128,15.660032,One of the comments Uh we had on on Facebook came from Ian Mulrooney Uh He says the amount of hangers on in the gooi every tournament free lunches dinners and bogeys Can the public see your accounts Now the public can see our accounts,0.98,1.0
74,en-US,1272.4200448,13.8099712,They're published every year in our Uh in our yearbook And obviously golf clubs attending the AGM from from 2018 on are going to be handed copies of those as the go in But his other point hangers-on in the guy at every tournament lunches dinners and Bogey's,0.95,1.0
75,en-US,1286.249984,19.3299456,What's your response to that Um Um Um It's going to sound flippant but Um yeah they got free bogeys so that they can go out and give rulings on the golf course Uh You hardly expect them to pay for the buggy when they're using it to go and give a ruling about a tournament that we need their help at,0.94,1.0
76,en-US,1307.9200767999998,15.9599616,Um I don't know I've worked for the guy for approaching 20 years Um You know people of course volunteers are Uh fed when they're working for the day had a golf tournament You know we we have people out there from six o'clock in the morning to till dark,0.96,1.0
77,en-US,1324.0300544,16.1399808,And Um the thought that they would have to pay for their meals when they're volunteering that level of time is kind of sickening to be honest Um We don't have hangers on Everyone who is in attendance at a guy championship Uh has a function and,0.98,1.0
78,en-US,1340.6199808,16.770048,Right Some are are busier than others The referees Um who are on the golf course all day long a starter who's on the first tee all day long Um corridors and so on have more time They spend more time actually physically doing something or working at a tournament than some other volunteers,0.97,1.0
79,en-US,1357.400064,18.109952,For example some of the more honorary roles the figurehead type roles Um who may have to make a speech at a presentation or whatever Um But the figurehead people are spending all of their time representing the guy and speaking to local members and spectators and players,0.98,1.0
80,en-US,1376.3198975999999,16.6801408,So it's just not true that there are hangers on Um And Uh I've heard this common before Um And it's just it's an insult to the people who gave so freely of their spare time to help the guy do what it does,0.97,1.0
81,en-US,1394.3199743999999,13.44,Gareth Shaw who I think you'll know Uh he says I think a majority of golf course green fees are far too cheap And that is why more and more are leaving traditional golf club membership to avail of more selection and variety,1.0,1.0
82,en-US,1408.0,15.079936,What about trends in membership costs against green fee prices over the last 10 years What's your your thoughts on that Yeah we we touched on that earlier And I don't think comparing them is is probably wise Um in that there is way more to being a member than playing your golf,0.91,1.0
83,en-US,1423.1800832,17.8499584,There should be at least Um And the golf club offers way more than than just a couple of games of golf a week or a month or whatever the case may be Uh But having said that there is a valid point here and that's that Um for people who are making that judgment strictly on a golf on a number of,0.98,1.0
84,en-US,1441.0300416,15.119974399999998,rounds of golf played per year Uh the green fee route or the open competition route Um if they decide to be a member of a club that doesn't cost so much to get their handicap or whatever Uh that route is attractive to some people more attractive than the membership route,0.99,1.0
85,en-US,1457.9199999999998,18.99008,Um And I think that will solve itself over time It's it's partly due to the downturn in the economy Um A lot of golf clubs being under receivership or in Naama charging below cost rates for green fees and in effect in order to get revenue in,0.97,1.0
86,en-US,1476.9100799999999,18.2398976,So they kept the place going whilst it was Uh being arranged to be sold or transferred or whatever Um And I think we're kind of nearing the end of that cycle And I would expect that green fee rates Um Uh once those clubs are either sold or weeded out or they're closed or whatever Uh the green fee rates will start to increase,0.98,1.0
87,en-US,1495.9000575999999,15.379968,Um and hopefully Uh narrow the gap that's there at the moment Brian Ōtomo Uh also on Facebook and a related point He's talking about the amount of open competitions every week across Ireland He says that a club needs members to survive and also to build a club in every way,0.99,1.0
88,en-US,1511.2900608,12.329984,And he goes on to suggest two things that the guy should perhaps bring in a maximum amount of single competitions per week and bring in a minimum amount of competitions that members have to play on their own course each year,1.0,1.0
89,en-US,1523.9200767999998,15.56992,Your thoughts on that Yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't really be inclined to to bring in a maximum Um amount of single competitions per week per club Uh I think that's always interfering in an area where you know these are revenue generators for for some clubs,0.98,1.0
90,en-US,1540.2699776,13.199974399999999,Um They wouldn't be on if the players weren't playing in them So obviously there's a demand for those type of competitions So I wouldn't be inclined to meddle with that one Um The second one around Um the minimum amount of competitions a member has to play at their own course,0.99,1.0
91,en-US,1553.8000895999999,9.589964799999999,That's something that every course can introduce if they so wish You know you can have any condition of membership you want Um I don't think it's right for the guy to move to introduce a a blanket condition like that,0.97,1.0
92,en-US,1563.3999872,23.729971199999998,But you know if there are clubs that feel that they that they Uh they they want their members playing in more competitions for work for you know for revenue purposes or for whatever purpose Uh then they they Uh they can go about introducing introducing that if it's a if it's something that Um Brian is suggesting we we introduce so that it,0.98,1.0
93,en-US,1587.1299583999999,19.2800768,stops the clubs that are Um Selling handicaps Um Uh then that sledgehammer to crack and not stuff because you're you're talking about bringing in a condition that will affect 400 clubs for the sake of dealing with Um a very small number So again I wouldn't be inclined to do that from a from a GeoEye perspective,0.97,1.0
94,en-US,1607.0699008,12.450099199999999,Jonny Byrne who's the head pro at Royal Tower has been in touch on Facebook and he says I'd like to see a guy rating system of golf courses and facilities I'd also like to see a star rating applied similar to the hotel industry,0.97,1.0
95,en-US,1619.7300223999998,15.2699904,I'm constantly having prices from other clubs thrown at me And when they don't have anywhere near the services provided at our facility the star rating should reflect green fee rates Any chance the GOP would consider that approach Um yeah,0.98,1.0
96,en-US,1636.199936,17.7600512,It's it's something the GOP has resisted Um for for some time and it's something that people have asked for Uh for for some time I don't really see it as a role of the golfing union of Ireland as such And that the guy is a is it isn't the governing body for golf in Ireland,0.98,1.0
97,en-US,1654.4100352,12.479999999999999,Um It is it's the governing body for four male amateur golf in Ireland Uh And we don't really have a role to play in telling the overall club including the ladies the women in the club the boys and girls and the business of the club,0.97,1.0
98,en-US,1666.8900351999998,17.809919999999998,We don't really have a role in in raising it Um If if there is Uh something to be done there probably rests with the likes the CGI Uh to to to come up with some sort of a rating scheme Um But then again I'm not too sure it's the right body to do it either,0.99,1.0
99,en-US,1684.7099904,12.8699392,You know it for these things to be done properly I think they need something They need an independent body with a rating system as opposed to a body which the clubs are a member of Rating Uh Rating them which is is is kind of complex,0.99,1.0
100,en-US,1697.5799296,14.6400256,So Uh yeah I think I think there's there's something in the idea I'm not too I'm sure the guy is not the right vehicle for it I'm not sure the CGI is the right vehicle for us Um Um But but I'm not quite sure who is maybe one for Uh future discussion,0.99,1.0
101,en-US,1712.4300799999999,17.309900799999998,And finally Willy Jaquet Sico on Twitter he asks two questions Why do the guy support Naama or bankrolling clubs whose pricing structure has put member and clubs in trouble Let's deal with that one first OK Um I don't know what he means by support,0.87,1.0
102,en-US,1730.9100032,22.949887999999998,Uh You know when the guy deals with the golf club that is the group of male amateur golfers that are affiliated to the GeoEye Uh And so if a group of male amateur golf golfers form a club and happen to use a Naama facility or a facility that's in receivership as their course Um our only power would be to punish,0.96,1.0
103,en-US,1753.8598912,14.970060799999999,the golfers that are playing on the golf course as opposed to the actual facility with no relationship with the owner of the facility or indeed with NAMA if Naam is in control of the facility Um So we continue to support the club because the club is the group of male amateur golfers that spells their subscription in or in,0.95,1.0
104,en-US,1768.8299519999998,22.1401088,return for services And just one other question then Uh on that Why did the guy allow certain clubs poach good an Uh up and coming players from from smaller clubs Why why do we allow that to happen Yeah Uh I think you probably have to put yourself in the shoes of the player and their support network the parents coaches and,0.98,1.0
105,en-US,1790.9700607999998,23.5800576,so on If you're Uh if you're a really really good player Um who has the potential to be an international player Um or you know make a living out of the game you're going to want to be around similar players And so what happens is players move and migrate Uh to golf courses that are maybe bigger golf courses a more challenging,0.98,1.0
106,en-US,1814.5501184,19.529932799999997,golf courses with more Um Um you know Yes plus handicap golfers who are part of senior culp's squads or potential squads or whatever Uh And the player makes that decision to move It's really hard to it's really hard to say to the player you know what you shouldn't do it offer for the guy to bring in some sort of a,0.94,1.0
107,en-US,1834.0800511999998,16.2299904,condition that would bar a player in that situation from making a move that is the right thing for that player's development Um Now that doesn't answer the question of poaching Um but any measure that we might introduce and we've looked at a number of different things,0.99,1.0
108,en-US,1850.3100416,20.4300288,We we we we could do But any measure that we we Uh I guess it's for somebody and maybe maybe one the listeners might come up with something But the challenge is to come up with a condition or a rule that will prohibit poaching but that will allow the free movement of a player from one club to another,0.97,1.0
109,en-US,1870.7400704,18.9599744,if it's not player's choice Um having not being approached or poached Um And that's the real conundrum And so Uh one final question then I have to ask how are discussions going on One governing body Um Yeah they've gone very well We we set up a group a discussion group two years ago Uh with,0.99,1.0
110,en-US,1889.829888,20.1299968,I urge you to Um the job of that group was to bring a proposal to the boards of both organizations Uh The group consulted widely with clubs and volunteers of the GeoEye and I you and with other stakeholders and set up various work groups to assist it in its in its process of producing a proposal,0.97,1.0
111,en-US,1910.2599168,19.1401984,The proposal has been finalized and it's been presented the book both boards It will go out for briefing with provincial councils and district executives early next year and then briefing or clubs And ultimately then it will be put to a vote Um with a view to the new body being up and running Um probably in the beginning of 2020,0.99,1.0
112,en-US,1929.939968,13.44,Uh It's probably a bit ambitious to try and get it up and running before that given this next year Uh will host the biggest championships we've ever ever held together with the Ilja of the World Amateur Team Championships in Khatun House Uh in August and September,0.96,1.0
113,en-US,1943.7400063999999,18.5700352,So Um that may well delay implementation of the new body a little bit But we were confident that it would be up and running in in 2020 You're listening to the Guey podcast sponsored by the Guys National Golf Academy book A Golf Lesson Now at Better Golf Dot IEEE,0.94,1.0
