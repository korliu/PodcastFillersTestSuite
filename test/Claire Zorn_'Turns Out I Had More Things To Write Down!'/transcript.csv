0,en-US,8.4,13.1400016,Welcome to the Tokyo podcast I'm sure I'm doing I'm so happy to be sitting here today talking to the amazing Clair's on about her brand new book When We Are Invisible Hello Claire Thanks so much for coming in,0.92,1.0
1,en-US,21.779999999999998,11.899999999999999,Thank you for having me I was saying before the podcast that last time you were here you mentioned that you were writing this book And I was very excited because I had previously read the sky so heavy Yes,0.96,1.0
2,en-US,33.69,14.49,And the idea of that story continuing was extremely exciting Then we had like a pandemic and Oh yeah that was And now and now you're here Yeah And the book is out I am sorry for the people listening,0.93,1.0
3,en-US,48.19,11.4200032,Could you just tell them a little bit about when we are invisible OK so it is the sequel to this guy So heavy Um So it's difficult me to talk about it without talking a little bit about who heavy,0.96,1.0
4,en-US,59.610003199999994,26.099993599999998,But basically Uh that tells the story of a group of teenagers Uh in the aftermath of a massive nuclear disaster Uh in Sydney Um Um And they're just trying to survive basically Um Um And when we are invisible follows on from that I don't really know how much to give away about,1.0,1.0
5,en-US,85.8300032,15.9299968,It's so tricky because maybe we don't know how much to give away about the end of the sky so heavy But it's really hard to because it picks up pretty much Yeah Moments after this Yeah There's not much of a time gap,0.98,1.0
6,en-US,101.88,16.8,No there's not Um So I guess look if you're listening to this and you're sensitive to spoilers Yeah Mild mild sporn Spoiler warning for Yes Geisa heavy miles of course during the course of this conversation you know Yes Details of the first book might slip by,0.95,1.0
7,en-US,118.71000319999999,19.7999872,But we'll try and keep it largely spoiler free We'll try to be as vague as possible Yeah So I I think I mean to me one of the most interesting questions that I've been wanting to ask you was you know I read this guy so heavy around about the time that it came out,0.96,1.0
8,en-US,138.5399936,17.120012799999998,Yeah And never got the sense that it was part of the series Like I was like that feels like a complete story Yes Um And then and now it's Um eight years Yeah Yeah I'm not very good with math Yeah I'm I'm amount of here,0.94,1.0
9,en-US,155.82000639999998,18.6599936,Yeah 2013 that came out and we are now at 20 and 21 So yeah Yes Well done us for making it Yeah we got there Sure So like So it's eight years later now but presumably when you started writing this book it was you know a few,0.94,0.99
10,en-US,174.5500032,20.0300032,Yeah Yeah Um Where did you always know the story was waiting in the wings or did it did you know did you think it was finished when you finished this Yeah I did OK Um I was I think when I very first started writing this guy so heavy I wanted to do three books and then I wrote one,0.97,1.0
11,en-US,196.19000319999998,22.949990399999997,Oh man that I'm not I don't want to do any more of that That's yeah it is finished Yeah we are done Um So I did try and kind of I always thought of it as a self-contained one book thing Um but I also had a sense of what happened after Um the book finished to my characters,0.96,1.0
12,en-US,221.11999999999998,15.390003199999999,Um But I've been pressured for a really long time Um by readers wanting to know yes they won't give me a line about it So Uh and then it was just in my head and it was just bubbling away And I didn't really feel like I had anything else to add,0.99,1.0
13,en-US,237.990016,13.0099968,Um It's so funny to hear you say that because there's a lot that it was added a lot that was added Yeah So I didn't feel like I had much left to say And then Um some things happened in the world and I was like hmm,0.98,1.0
14,en-US,251.0899968,13.8000128,Yeah Turns out you're wrong And I've got a few more things to write down Yeah Yeah I love I love that about this book It's Um you know you finished this guy so heavy It ends on this this hopeful note,0.89,1.0
15,en-US,265.1000064,15.7799936,Yeah And then this book picks it right up And what was previously like this hopeful possibilities that they're heading towards to you show people will This is what this is what they landed in Yeah And it's pretty intense,0.98,1.0
16,en-US,280.97000959999997,14.9999872,It's pretty intense And the the thing I love about this as a kind of as it stands as a geology I guess is that you have these two books that are actually they're on the same topic and it's the same characters,0.99,1.0
17,en-US,296.0,15.929984,Yeah But they are very different in sort of scope And like I guess they're the same in tone but it's kind of like different sides of a coin or something like you switched character perspectives Yeah You've Um you've taken things down from like a,0.98,1.0
18,en-US,312.97000959999997,15.4200064,A city and a world into a small commune with a small amount of people and it's very stifling Yeah So yeah there's just Um a really different feel to this book And yet at the same time it's a natural continuation of the story,0.95,1.0
19,en-US,328.4200192,21.7199872,So I don't know I guess my I guess my question is is that hard to sort of revisit those characters and switch it up like that Uh What Yes Yes it was Yeah Um because I decided Um that I wanted to write from Lacey's perspective,0.97,1.0
20,en-US,351.28,20.5499904,But when I started to go back into that headspace of the SCUSA heavy it was like I just slipped back into Finn's voice which just sounded like Fien and I couldn't even It took so long to get out of his head and to work out who this person was who this he was because you know she's kind,0.95,1.0
21,en-US,371.8299904,17.310028799999998,of like a Um secondary character in the sky So maybe she's not the main Um one So I did have to get to know her a little bit better Um Um And then when that started to happen then different parts of the story kind of started to show themselves,0.95,1.0
22,en-US,390.2799872,17.52,Um Yeah Yeah It's it's interesting I did reread this guy so heavy in preparation Oh did you Yeah I did It's a it's such a wild experience you know like I had remembered that there'd been a while and I was terrible but I'd remembered the bare bones of the fairy and the characters and stuff,0.93,1.0
23,en-US,408.33999359999996,16.6799872,But when you read a book that you've read write you you can have this echo of your emotions the first time you read it Yes And it's this one was particularly strange because I was reading this book and I can remember the experience of reading it the first time but I was rereading this book about food shortages,0.97,1.0
24,en-US,425.0199808,18.2400256,and going to the supermarket and there's nothing there And it was just read very very differently in 2021 than it did in twenty thirteen or fourteen Yeah And I initially read it Um so So that was wild And it was also then really interesting to go from being in Finn's head,0.97,1.0
25,en-US,443.6499968,15.000012799999999,And he does have such a like a it's nice being in Fin's He's such a nice boy like he's very gentle So yeah I'm like Um I don't mean to say that as though he's is not nice It's just that it's just strange to then seep in,0.92,1.0
26,en-US,458.8900352,13.289932799999999,Yeah From Yeah You've been in Yeah And now you've seen them through the point of view of someone who loves him yet Um but he's perhaps maybe asking for something from him in this book that it takes him a little while to take it,0.94,1.0
27,en-US,472.32998399999997,14.7800064,Yeah And so that was an interesting experience for me as a writer because you know these characters so well You've been in his head for an entire book You know that he You know he's qualities you know that you you hope he's going to come through,0.96,1.0
28,en-US,487.13999359999997,15.900006399999999,Yeah but Um but being on the U.S. side of it which brings me I guess to some of the themes in this Yes we can talk about the fact that you're in You've brought Max and Finn and Lacey to the commune which was they're like happily ever after,0.96,1.0
29,en-US,503.1000064,18.4200192,Yes That's the spot All right Yeah Sorry Miles I love that Um And now they're there and they're safe Sort of Uh got a breather Yeah And suddenly they don't have to be worried about food or people chasing them or not having their papers or anything like that,0.94,1.0
30,en-US,522.0300288,22.4999936,But it doesn't take Lucy very long for her instincts to tell her that something's not right in coming And then it's a matter of Um her working through what's wrong And I guess I again not trying to give away too many details I guess the thing is is that what you're talking about here is,0.97,1.0
31,en-US,545.7399808,21.5600128,Control and power and controlling people through fear Yes And Um gaslighting people Yes gaslighting the big one and abusing people emotionally and physically I guess and in particular women Yeah So these themes that you go into in this book Um and you do it so well and so powerfully whilst writing for children that's a tyrant,0.97,1.0
32,en-US,568.0699903999999,26.5700352,Really Yeah Uh Really Yeah And bravo Because I feel like Uh just as you did in the sky so heavy And the reason why this book has so much love out there I think is in large part because of if you're a teacher Um and you're looking for a book to discuss issues of climate change and Um you know like so,0.98,1.0
33,en-US,594.6400256,13.0499584,much trauma there's a lot in there Yeah Yeah There's so much to unpack in that book but it's entirely like Uh It's not like handing them an adult book you know it's a book for children it's written You're great at getting in the mindset of kids,0.98,1.0
34,en-US,609.1299839999999,16.6800384,Um And I guess for the same way that a book like Tomorrow When the War Began has endured Uh Yeah You know it's been really embraced by schools Yeah And so then generations of students read it Yeah And now they're getting the second chapter of this story,0.98,1.0
35,en-US,625.8400256,22.719948799999997,Yeah Um but I veered away from right away a little bit from where I was asking about the themes of the book Yes Do you want to expound on this Yeah Yeah Yeah I remember now Um Uh So Um Talking about themes,0.94,1.0
36,en-US,649.9999743999999,10.9799936,Um Just give me a sec Well while you're thinking I'll tell you a moment from the book that I think is going to stay with me for a long time Oh please do And as I've been talking about your book to people this is the thing,0.99,1.0
37,en-US,661.3100032,17.279999999999998,I'm like look if you don't mind hearing about one scene in the book Yeah it's a small moment Yeah I think it's going to give anything away Um But this is going to stick with me And it's a moment when Lucy is called upon to do something that requires like you know some brute physical strength and some toughness,0.99,1.0
38,en-US,678.8900351999999,20.339968,Yeah Um And and she's just in her head She has this thought that's like she's jealous of Finn because whilst she knows there's a lot of pressure on men and boys to be tough and be strong and live up to those that gender stereotype Um if they fail,0.95,1.0
39,en-US,699.6199935999999,18.0900352,The only thing they're really risking is their own pride Yeah They will look weak and they have to wear that Whereas for Lucy who is trying to prove that she's capable and strong just like a young boy would except in her case and Uh the case of any woman who tries to prove this,0.98,1.0
40,en-US,718.1899776,10.5900544,You feel like there's more than your own pride at risk of sort of carrying all women with you and trying to prove that all women can do this And if you fail it's kind of like you're saying women,0.95,1.0
41,en-US,729.1500032,22.9599744,Yes And the pressure of that is like A thousand times magnified a lot of pressure Yeah I feel it every time I try and do a reverse part Yeah I do I can do this kind of thing But it really struck a nerve with me because I'm like it's a thing every so often someone perfectly expresses a,0.95,1.0
42,en-US,752.1099776,13.2200448,thing that you felt a bunch of times but no one's ever succinctly said Yeah And I was like you know that is what it is Yeah Because when you're in any sort of environment professionally in sports in anything,0.98,1.0
43,en-US,765.3300224,14.2299648,Yeah When you're Um we're all told that girls can do anything the boys can do but you don't always feel that that is true And when you're trying to prove it to yourself and to the world it's more than it's not just about you,0.98,1.0
44,en-US,779.650048,12.489984,And it is kind of nice to think about what it would be like if it is just about like if Yeah that's what it feels to be a young boy trying to prove their own strength and it gets to be all about all about them,0.95,1.0
45,en-US,792.2500096,11.550003199999999,Yeah I can do this Yeah I did it And I'm one of the boys Yeah Instead of I can do this and so can women Yeah I believe But you know like the representative of half the population in the world,0.95,1.0
46,en-US,803.8400512,14.5699328,Yeah Yeah That really that is going to stick with me Um And I think that really speaks to a Lucie's character Yeah Yeah She's under a lot of pressure Oh my gosh Yeah Yeah But she's got grace under fire,0.97,1.0
47,en-US,818.6200064,16.2700288,Yeah Um There's also another moment later in the book where she Uh has opportunity to read what someone has thought about her character And that was a that was an amazing moment She has struggled through an entire book filled with self-doubt,0.97,1.0
48,en-US,834.909952,17.2200448,Yeah Forced to No one believes her You know why would you why people don't believe what teenage girls say That story those nobody will listen to me and everybody will believe me Stories are always so Um Uh It's like agonizing to read because I think everyone's experience,0.96,1.0
49,en-US,852.169984,11.9299584,Yeah on some level Yeah She's gone through a whole book of this with lives in the balance Um It's not just like no one will believe me that something's happening but no one will believe me And where And there's serious danger,0.97,1.0
50,en-US,864.130048,20.7599616,Yeah Um To contend with And then she has this moment where she reads like a dossier that's been written about Yeah And I don't know if I can That was powerful Thank you Yeah that was that was one of those things that right at the end of the whole process of you know six drafts or whatever it was,0.98,1.0
51,en-US,884.8900096,17.029939199999998,I decided to kind of put that in right at the end I'm glad I'm glad you did It's a it's a it's a moment to sit in because you You know this Uh opinion of her has been like a group effort like but you know that particular people involved,0.99,1.0
52,en-US,902.7600384,20.659916799999998,Uh It just adds another layer of complication to a very complicated character Um Was it speaking of this character here I guess it's okay to name is Jackson Yeah What was it like to write a character like Jackson Um Or if there's something if you had to explain the character of Jackson,0.98,1.0
53,en-US,923.4599936,29.6599552,Yeah that's what would you say Are there so many words None of them are coming to mind I know he's probably one of the most complex I think originally he came Uh from me trying to understand It's really hard to talk about him without going way back to the very first seeds of the story which is when,0.98,1.0
54,en-US,955.3900543999999,19.6499456,A man called Donald Trump was elected in America That was the inspiration the first spark Yeah that was when I was like I think I need to write something that makes so much sense Yeah because it was like well this guy's a total misogynist and he's celebrated for that,0.98,1.0
55,en-US,975.4699776,14.300057599999999,Mm hmm Like people still think there was stuff on tape that he had said about women and people either overlooked it or explained it away And I think a lot of the reasoning for it was oh there's a job that has to be done,0.98,1.0
56,en-US,989.7700351999999,15.2399872,And yeah And this is the man for the job which is very much Yes What the sentiment is towards Jackson here Here's a person who if you individually and in a safe environment where they could not be overheard ask people what do you think of this guy,0.93,1.0
57,en-US,1005.3699584,17.3401088,They probably wouldn't have that much good to say But he is the person they have given their trust to to get them through this situation Yeah So I started to think about why someone like that would end up with so much power and what would make people Um hand over so much trust and power to someone like that,0.98,1.0
58,en-US,1025.5300608,17.1598848,Um And I was also thinking about Um Notions of kind of charisma and charm and what makes you initially like someone and what is it about them that Starts to feel off after a little while and I'm just so tired of,1.0,1.0
59,en-US,1043.7499904,20.4300288,Oh I don't know how like I'm so tired of the statistic that stat the statistics you hear Um about women being killed by partners or former partners I'm just like this is an argument It's really what we move on,0.9,1.0
60,en-US,1064.189952,17.710079999999998,We like stuff happens in the news And then it's shocking that we move on and it happens over and over again And women are still entering into these relationships And it's because they don't if it was obvious what this man was like,0.99,1.0
61,en-US,1083.08992,15.3901056,People you wouldn't hand trust over No and it's also and you address this in the book really well there's a there's a character from Lucy's past Yeah And a character in the present who are both in relationships Yeah,0.96,1.0
62,en-US,1098.7800576,16.889958399999998,With an abusive partner Yeah And I think so much of this I mean you could spend a lifetime unpacking the reasons why Yeah And I don't want to breeze over it but I think One element Um of it is that,0.99,1.0
63,en-US,1116.8499712,14.9100544,The shame Uh or feeling stupid Um about having You don't want to admit there is a problem because then you have given your trust and love to a problematic person and people struggle to admit that out of not wanting to seem,0.99,1.0
64,en-US,1132.6999552,21.9899904,Weak or stupid Yeah And this is brought up in the book that there's no there's absolutely no shame in buying into a version of someone that they're trying to make you buy into Yes because they're actively trying to present a version of themselves that that you will want to have in your life if you fall for that,0.99,1.0
65,en-US,1155.3800191999999,14.1500416,You're just the average person Yeah Yeah Yeah The fault is with the you know perpetrator No One 100 percent Yeah Um And I think that's I mean that's really Well there's so much in this book because a lot Yeah,0.93,1.0
66,en-US,1169.5399936,22.6799616,And that was a really big part of it I think when I was writing that kind of stuff I just I think it's extraordinary to me when authors like yourself are able to broach all of these subjects You know a book that is for kids Um because at,0.97,1.0
67,en-US,1193.4000128,19.6799488,Like it just must be very delicate work It is Um But they're also super smart like Yes And that's that's the delicate ness of it Yeah top down You can't spoon feed but you also can't be too Yeah You can't cross a line that would make it adult fiction,0.96,1.0
68,en-US,1213.1099648,12.2600448,Yeah Um You still want it to be accessible and you still want them to have some sort of sense of hope Yeah At the end of it all Yeah And that's you know that's a lot though That's a lot to manage,0.99,1.0
69,en-US,1225.3800448,12.089958399999999,It's a balancing act And this is the first book that I've written knowing while I'm writing it that my eldest son is going to read it as soon as it's finished being written So what did he think of it,0.99,1.0
70,en-US,1237.5000063999998,13.1099648,I loved it Yeah it's amazing Yeah I mean it's not it's not amazing It's a must be wonderful Oh it was No it really wasn't amazing Like he wouldn't stop reading it So we're trying to have dinner and he's trying to read,0.95,1.0

73,en-US,1278.3299584,19.7600256,Like what He was a bit blindsided because he snuck into my office my like workspace Um and read some notes that I had written about ending But that's yet another huge company going into it that he was buying Yeah like say sneaky Christmas present,0.92,1.0
74,en-US,1298.1499904,12.6000128,Yeah I know everything that kids go looking for Wow Okay cool So that was pretty great Uh But things have changed Yeah So he was a bit shocked Now I want to ask you about the different ending You can we can talk about it later,0.93,1.0
75,en-US,1310.9900288,17.0500096,Okay Cool Sorry Um Sorry to spoil our fashion But I think when I was writing it because I was writing it knowing that he liked writing it was kind of a parent brain as well I don't want to Frighten him,0.96,1.0
76,en-US,1328.0601087999999,16.229888,I don't want him to read it and just go oh the world is so terrible and so terrifying That's not I think that's what I that's not what I want to do at all I want him to read it and perhaps be more aware of stuff but also have some sort of sense if he's ironing,0.97,1.0
77,en-US,1345.5500287999998,16.5599232,Power like you know that's the beautiful thing about writing for teenagers and young adults is that we're all OK Look it's really hard to admit but we're all going to die And yeah and they are going to inherit what we have made for them,0.96,1.0
78,en-US,1362.8000256,15.600025599999999,So it's like oh there's a big sense of responsibility to equiv Yeah The skills they need That I think is what I'm getting at where I'm sort of a bit in awe of people who can do this because it is one thing to explore these issues,0.99,1.0
79,en-US,1379.3999872,20.3800576,When you're writing for adults Yeah that's no holds barred Yeah you can just be as dark and as grim and as graphic Yeah So yeah because these topics are not light you know but imparting the seriousness of it to children without being condescending,0.96,1.0
80,en-US,1399.8000127999999,15.990067199999999,Yeah Is it something that I don't understand how anyone does it So when people do it I'm just a little bit in awe of it I don't know how to do Well but you did And so and I'm I'm so excited at the time of recording this podcast,0.95,1.0
81,en-US,1417.1899904,12.5400064,Are we just before pub date or did we just Uh it's just gone it's gone OK so last week Right OK so have you heard Um much feedback from readers yet Is it a bit early It's a little early Yeah,0.93,1.0

83,en-US,1449.8000895999999,13.9999232,It's not like a walk in the park Yeah Um Really scary So I think you know early feedback has been good Yeah Yeah I really think all of the people here have been hounding you the past eight years for it,0.98,1.0
84,en-US,1463.9699968,11.52,Yes And I'm going to love this And I and I know perhaps you don't know the answer to this I don't know how long it took you to It was years in the making to revisit them to decide to revisit this,0.96,1.0
85,en-US,1475.9399423999998,19.480064,So maybe it's a maybe maybe not but the book finishes and it's complete And again you know if you never return to this it is it does feel finished Yeah But there is a sound somewhat of an epilog with a bit of a pre switch that suggests a possible direction has no merit,0.93,1.0
86,en-US,1495.7299712,22.500044799999998,OK I just wondered But if I had asked you that question in 2014 you might have said there's no Yeah I probably would have Yeah I feel all of the best stories Um should feel finished but with enough Um Room to imagine the continuing loss of characters,0.91,1.0
87,en-US,1518.3299584,17.279999999999998,Yeah yeah so that's definitely what they have here Thank you Uh Yeah In terms of writing postapocalyptic films are you yourself a reader Oh yeah Interesting I was going to ask you what your favorite was No I don't know,0.91,1.0
88,en-US,1536.5999616,15.8600192,You know it's awful Do you avoid it in movies and TV Yeah OK I like visually I find it really interesting So when I first started writing Um The Skies so heavy Um it came back from a lot of places,0.93,1.0
89,en-US,1552.4599808,22.1000704,But I saw a picture I think a movie still from a movie with Um Oh Will his name's Will Action Action here We'll see where we go Yes I don't want to see the movie but I saw the poster of this overgrow in New York and just this one person,0.95,1.0
90,en-US,1574.5600511999999,19.8898688,And I'm quite fascinated by like Um abandoned spaces So I love pictures of abandoned shopping malls all that kind of stuff There's something hypnotic about it Yeah Um So I find imagery really Um interesting but I have no desire to read books that I've only read one,0.97,1.0
91,en-US,1594.44992,15.060070399999999,So I read one when I was in year eight called Children of the Dust And I'm pretty sure that's where this obsessive thing about nuclear winter started Wow Because that's also any kind of I mean that in the Cold War,0.97,1.0
92,en-US,1609.9300352,16.579993599999998,Yeah Children in the dark Yeah Check it out It's terrifying I am a big consumer of a post apocalyptic Really when I say that I really like you know that that's that's amazing Uh That is because I go out and read a lot of it and I don't I don't know why,0.95,1.0
93,en-US,1626.5200639999998,16.7699456,I think actually I blame is about comedy Um or I think I should say Yeah because I read her Um scuttling and Obernewtyn books when I was forming my ID in my younger years And it really got me interested in speculative fiction about what will happen,0.96,1.0
94,en-US,1643.3199104,20.100096,Yeah Yeah And the event Yeah A disaster Yeah And I think I don't know I think some I think you can people on this topic fall into two camps after 2020 which is like oh I don't want any more I need distance or give me all of it because and I don't know where I sit,0.98,1.0
95,en-US,1663.4200064,13.980057599999999,I kind of feel like I fit in It took her it took a quiz on book two to make me go Okay Yeah I definitely intervened but I had been a little bit wary because yeah it's kind of don't want to be reading about it when you've been,0.95,1.0
96,en-US,1678.8199424,18.100121599999998,Going through Totally you need to escape Yeah Yeah Yeah But I think that we know that people Um like the consumption of Um movies like Pandemic and Contagion and all that kind of thing went through the roof Apparently did because that's so fascinating,0.99,1.0
97,en-US,1696.9399296,11.1900672,And that's the thing I remembered when I was reading your book And the thing that you know I'm a I tend to get sparked off on little mini crises in reading Yeah I read something like that was just what I needed,0.97,1.0
98,en-US,1708.1299967999998,13.7399296,I will now seek out OK five or 10 other books Yeah So I I played this out and I went on to something else Yeah And so you've put me on a bit of a postapocalyptic made because I read the book and I was like that was just what I needed,0.92,1.0
99,en-US,1722.6500096,17.5900672,And also it reminded me that the reason we write these books usually unless it's like some Cormac McCarthy like oh wow Yeah Unless it's something quite grim and hopeless That's why I've actually Yeah There's no jokes Yeah This isn't going to end well,0.94,1.0
100,en-US,1740.2599424,18.6300416,Yeah Like Murshid amazing book author Not what I want to read right now I just I feel like they a post apocalyptic novel with a hopeful ending Really cathartic Yeah And I wonder if it's like a sense of Um camaraderie,0.98,1.0
101,en-US,1759.0099968,15.329894399999999,Like I wonder if it's I always find this stuff interesting Like my my brother used to be a firefighter and he read so many stories and watched so much stuff about firefighters And I'm just like Like what Why didn't you want to get away,0.97,1.0
102,en-US,1774.8000768,13.639884799999999,Exactly No but no So I'm fascinated by this Yeah This kind of aspect of our psyche that wants to delve into something that's scary It's a I think it's a lot about what type of radio you are as well,0.96,1.0
103,en-US,1788.5898751999998,18.8901376,Yeah totally We are drawn to stories Really to work through emotions and yeah some catharsis yeah so if if something is playing on your mind a lot that's a story that you might be drawn to So you know by that reasoning Uh postapocalyptic notes should have a huge bearing real spike,0.89,1.0
104,en-US,1807.7800447999998,17.9099648,Yeah Yeah You're lucky you started just before Yeah I know Hey Yeah Don't go up next year Now before we're sort of running a bit short on time But we we did say before this podcast that we were talk about horses,0.93,1.0
105,en-US,1825.829888,15.3401344,Oh I need to bring them up Uh I finally managed to get some in my books I've been waiting for an opportunity for a really long time So you are yourself a horse or not Yeah Well that's enough Absolute obsessive,0.9,1.0
106,en-US,1841.2900352,17.9699712,And you know our best form of transport Uh nuclear winter Definitely Yeah definitely I think maybe that's another reason why I started writing about any kilometer as well Yeah So it's like no cars What are we going to use horses and say Lucy's knowledge of horses,0.93,1.0
107,en-US,1859.290112,16.079871999999998,Yeah So that's that's You're coming from You didn't have to research Nah I'm straight for me Yeah So once I have to do any research all the books I've had to like I don't know much about big wave surfing but I had to really get into that for one thing that day,0.92,1.0
108,en-US,1875.369984,12.5898752,And that this one I was like actually know what I'm talking about Well us That's time consuming It made me think you know if you're really going to prepare for Uh the end of days you should probably just get riding lessons,0.93,1.0
109,en-US,1888.0200704,25.0200064,Yeah yeah Yeah But this you know I mean I I didn't try and just sneak them in there for having a horse You know that was very funny But like I also find it Um I find horses really fascinating as as far as like talking about trust guys because they're very sensitive emotional creatures and they tune in really,0.91,1.0
110,en-US,1913.0400768,15.269888,well to humans Um And so there's a great kind of reciprocal trust thing that goes on because that where predators like they look at us and they know from where our eyes are on our faces that we're predators Wow,0.98,1.0
111,en-US,1928.3398656,17.640038399999998,And yet they trust us so often Um So amazing when you put it like that And they're also like half a ton like mine is cranky I've got a cranky horse and he's wonderful very very moody Um And if he wanted to he could just like trample me Massood,0.96,1.0
112,en-US,1946.6999807999998,14.470144,But I know that he won't you know because you had me Yeah And I guess when you're writing characters how animals respond to a person and how a person treats animals is a good indicator of Yeah Kind of person that I find,0.93,1.0
113,en-US,1961.1899904,15.0800384,Yeah that's gold I think it's a it's a good way to be a little bit Um To to give away stuff about Um characters that yeah some like foreshadowing Yeah and then there's dogs in this as well So that's always good,0.95,1.0
114,en-US,1976.3699712,16.2400256,It's always good to have a dog around Yeah Yeah It's such a good book Just talking about it has made me Um really like it's an emotional read It's a Which is interesting when something is quite Um action driven as well,0.95,1.0
115,en-US,1992.8199167999999,15.119974399999998,Right Yeah The first book I guess had its quiet moments because there's a lot of the beginning of the book They're just waiting and yeah they're just trying to find food and yeah You know venturing out sporadically Yeah,0.95,1.0
116,en-US,2007.9398912,13.560012799999999,And then they travel a lot and then it's very action Yeah I'm driven for the second half of the novel The Swannee is like similar in a way because they they get to the Karmin and they're settling and they're meeting people and they're getting the lay of the land,0.97,1.0
117,en-US,2021.9498495999999,20.8502784,But there's also you know a lot of action venturing outside and hunting Yeah So with all of that going on he's actually we're very still very much inside his head Had it's very emotionally driven Yeah Um And you know when you live in a book really emotionally Uh and it is over,0.95,1.0
118,en-US,2043.1898623999998,15.2399872,Yeah it's times like these I'm really glad for my job because then I get to talk So you're very lucky Yeah very cool It's very cool Well I love the book a lot Um I've already asked you if there's a possibility of a third,0.97,1.0
119,en-US,2058.4298496,15.0300672,You have said nah no So in eight years we'll be back here Yeah Maybe the decision will change about if it's not if that's not on the immediate horizon are you able to tell us what is sort of coming up you Phenix or is that too too soon to say,0.93,1.0
120,en-US,2074.24,15.250022399999999,Um No it's not It just might be a little bit of a wait till it's out like there is start winning appetite's unless you're not allowed to No I'm allowed to talk like I you know I'm I'm the gatekeeper here Uh for this one,0.92,1.0
121,en-US,2089.5100927999997,21.4798336,No it's it's very different Like it's nothing like I've ever written before Um It's it's about a Um contemporary conceptual visual artist Oh Um But it's also quite satire kind of in flavor Satirical in flavor Sounds very interesting Yeah Is this it,0.99,1.0
122,en-US,2111.5899904,15.699968,I don't think so Yeah Wow Yeah Uh All right Yeah But the interesting thing about it is I think it's actually more of my natural writing voice Okay Um This character this tone of this book Yeah It feels more natural to me than that,0.96,1.0
123,en-US,2127.3700352,15.4400768,It's a very exciting to me But that's a ways off Yeah well I you know I haven't finished the first draft Okay So Always-On it's a but I've been waiting to write like I've been working on it on and off for five years OK,0.93,1.0
124,en-US,2142.8998143999997,17.1702272,And now I'm finally devoting all my time to it So that is very exciting Yeah I'm I'm excited by it Like I enjoy sitting down to work on it So that's good So this is I think what my awe of your skill to be able to write these books for children,0.97,1.0
125,en-US,2161.2099584,16.65024,Um I think the evidenced by your ability to just illustrate and write a picture book and then write for young adults and now writing for adults I think when authors have that kind of versatility if you pick up any one of their books you can kind of,0.98,1.0
126,en-US,2179.0099456,20.389888,Feel it Yeah You know like I think you can feel when a When someone is a storyteller for all ages Well yeah I think so I am excited to read your Um adult piece It's just amazing It's all just a game of pretend like you're just pretending like this is what right now what we're doing is sit down,0.95,1.0
127,en-US,2199.3998336,20.3001856,and imagine imaginary people and pretend Yeah it's an art form Yeah Yeah Like you're really good at pretending Thank you Yeah That skill could have manifested in many ways Yeah could have been a Cannata I know I'm glad you think,0.93,1.0
128,en-US,2220.329984,15.1599104,Well we get all your novels Yeah Yeah But interestingly enough that's kind of what the next book is about like pretending Mhm Do you have a con artist in your work Like obsessed I'm not going to make any comment to make comments to actually write this,0.87,0.99
