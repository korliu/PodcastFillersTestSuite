5,en-US,99.8399936,12.3600064,We are going to talk about living a toxic free lifestyle And Uh some of the things that we wanted to discuss is that the cleansing and bath products that we have in our home might not be as clean as we think they are,0.99,1.0
6,en-US,112.2300032,12.619993599999999,Many of them have toxic chemicals that can be very damaging to our health and our home And today's guest Ellen will be talking about the benefits of going natural what to look for in a home and body products,0.97,1.0
7,en-US,124.86000639999999,14.8199808,So please welcome to the show Ellen founder of Pink Elephant Products She is home grown right here in the D which is our home town And Uh I like to ask Uh Helen to say hello Hi there How are you today,0.94,1.0
8,en-US,140.76,23.4899968,I'm doing pretty well Glad to be here Thank you for being here today And so I want to know what sparked your interest to start your own outdraw bath and body product line Um A couple of different things Um Going through pregnancy and having children got me really concerned about Um the products that Uh I use in the home every day,0.99,1.0
9,en-US,164.2499968,15.150003199999999,from cosmetics to cleaning products to personal care products on both myself and my children everything from toothpaste to mouthwash baby powders Um And I became more and more concerned about the potential of ingredients in the products we use every day to cause disease,0.99,1.0
10,en-US,179.9400064,15.809996799999999,So I began thinking about things like the Teflon in our nonstick pans air fresheners talc based baby powders the flame retardants in children's pajamas in in our furniture off gassing into our homes Um And then Um unfortunately cancer had hit our family pretty hard,0.97,1.0
11,en-US,196.28999679999998,20.300006399999997,And I became even more specifically focused on carcinogens in Uh carcinogens are not the only carcinogens being ingredients that Um or things that Uh have the potential to cause cancer Um There's also concern about allergens in personal care and cleaning products So those were some of the motivators that I had,1.0,1.0
12,en-US,217.7100032,19.769983999999997,OK Well Um I have a question Sure First question I notice Uh are just about every product has some type of chemical that is to serve as a preservative Right But they're actually damaging while they're preserving the product and shelf life,0.96,1.0
13,en-US,237.47998719999998,17.910016,They're damaging to the human body Right Can you elaborate a little bit more on that Like what specific preservatives are really dangerous Um What I guess what should people look for when they read a label OK Um There's a lot of concern about a class of chemical preservatives known as parabens,0.99,1.0
14,en-US,255.83999999999997,17.939993599999998,So when I talk about Uh avoiding hormone disrupting chemicals in products that's Uh specifically a class of ingredients that an ingredient that I'm thinking of So parabens can penetrate the skin and act like a very weak estrogen in the body which is where the term hormone or endocrine disrupting chemical comes from,0.99,1.0
15,en-US,274.2899968,19.5600128,So Um this class of preservatives can potentially turn on the growth of hormone receptor positive breast cancers So that's the main concern with parabens Um Of course parabens are in fact very effective at what they do They prohibit the growth of dangerous microbes in products that might spend a few weeks or even months on a shelf before they're purchased,0.99,1.0
16,en-US,295.7399808,12.5400064,Um So Uh but unless a product is going to be used immediately like something you're making for your own personal use or at home Um if a product contains water unfortunately it does need to have an effective preservative Um It's just not optional,0.99,1.0
17,en-US,310.32,12.4199936,Um So consumers now are looking for paraben free products But so now we manufacturers have been replacing parabens with other preservative systems like and this is a long name and I still don't know quite how to pronounce this one methyl clora zaizen,0.98,1.0
18,en-US,322.7399936,12.9900288,And you also have Uh methyl lassos It's a tough one to pronounce but generally it's a big long name And it starts with them and has multiple syllables One of them is called it's generally referred to as MCI or am I,0.99,1.0
19,en-US,336.6000128,11.669964799999999,Um While these chemicals are not hormone disrupting chemicals they can be very irritating to the skin And as a matter of fact in 2013 Um am I was named the contact allergen of the year by the American Contact Dermatitis Society,0.99,1.0
20,en-US,348.29998079999996,17.3700352,Wow Uh Can be especially problematic for people with eczema allergies psoriasis or sensitive skin Um And you'll find both of these ingredients in Target's method products and in seven generations products Wow Amazing Because I know a lot of my Um products at our at our home are some of the method products,0.97,1.0
21,en-US,365.670016,11.8599936,And I think a lot of my friends are going towards a lot of those because they want to live a more natural lifestyle So being aware of not just taking what is on the front of the product label but really looking at those ingredients,1.0,1.0
22,en-US,377.5499776,9.5700224,Sure Um As I tell people that all the time when it comes to nutrition but even looking at that on any of your other products just don't take the face value of the advertised Mackley Exactly That's a very good point,0.97,1.0
23,en-US,387.4500096,14.5799936,So then my next question is what constitutes natural or organic Well unfortunately the word natural really has no well-defined regulated meaning Um So seeing the word natural on a product's label or in advertising unfortunately doesn't really mean anything specific at all,0.98,1.0
24,en-US,402.68999679999996,19.6199936,Um As a matter of fact Consumer Reports petitioned the Food and Drug Administration in 2014 to actually ban the use of the word natural on food labeling so that shoppers wouldn't be misled Um And the company Seventh Generation which is of course now owned by Unilever Uh settled a 4.5 million dollar class action lawsuit over its use of the term,0.99,1.0
25,en-US,422.3099904,16.9200128,100 percent natural and all natural on its product labels when in fact some of the products contain synthetic ingredients And those were settled in 2016 Um And I just want to interject and I know even though we're talking about home and health products Uh I believe I used to drink this particular juice all the time,0.99,1.0
26,en-US,439.52998399999996,15.030016,I can't remember the name of it I don't want to say the name of it actually for whatever purpose But I think they had a class action lawsuit placed against them for the same reason they weren't holding that they Um Uh were not GMO when in fact they were right,0.98,1.0
27,en-US,454.9000192,15.439974399999999,Hmm Well I think more and more because these larger multinational corporations want a piece of the big green pie You're going to see these large companies like for example Unilever owns ax body spray Um and a whole slew of other decidedly unnatural products,1.0,1.0
28,en-US,470.6400256,14.3399936,But they're buying up the smaller companies like for example Burt's Bees is owned by Clorox You're going to we're going to see more and more of that So the truth is what a oxymoron Right So the trust issue comes into play because as the smaller companies Anaïs is owned by Campbell's you know they make the macaroni and,0.96,1.0
29,en-US,484.98001919999996,10.9799936,cheese and Uh crackers and stuff like that So I think we're going to see more and more of that So this issue is going to become more and more important Um Companies wanting to put that you know they want a piece of that a piece of their pie,0.99,1.0
30,en-US,495.96001279999996,18.1499904,So they're going to put natural organic and those sorts of those trigger words on exactly one of my favorite Um I guess more natural Um health bars are exposed was recently bought out by Kellogg's a local company over here And I had a huge I think buy in the community that I'm in the health and wellness community,0.97,1.0
31,en-US,514.1100031999999,13.7100288,There was a huge uproar because it was like what is going to happen to this price Razzik azo ingredients these four simple ingredients is this going to change because now we are bowed out by a larger chain that is known for not necessarily going more of the natural route right,0.95,1.0
32,en-US,527.820032,22.229964799999998,Right Um now I know we've discussed the word natural but the word organic is actually Um a little bit different because Um so natural and organic are often mistaken as meaning the same thing But legally speaking they're really different OK because to list organic on a product label Um certification by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's national organic program is mandatory,0.99,1.0
33,en-US,550.2899712,13.379993599999999,If you're if you're doing things properly and labeling your products properly Uh then the name and address of the third party that certified the product has to be on the label However you'll often find hand crafters and smaller companies using the term sort of indiscriminately,0.97,1.0
34,en-US,564.5100032,16.979968,Um And I think some of that confusion lies in people thinking that the word natural and organic actually mean the same thing when they actually don't Um And the process for organic certification is actually very specific So Um the term organic is definitely more well-defined than the term natural,1.0,1.0
35,en-US,581.6699904,18.1600256,Can I interject also on this one Because I know even for the food industries Um everyone talks about how expensive it is to go organic when you're going to your local grocery store And I always try to explain that there's so many hoops that that these organic farmers have to go through in order to get that seal that,0.98,1.0
36,en-US,599.830016,16.0699904,it ends up pretty much bankrupting a lot of them especially if they are not making a mass production So they have to kind of put some of that Um the pricing that they have to get for that organic seal and pass it along to the consumer versus going to your local farmer's market,0.99,1.0
37,en-US,615.9000063999999,14.380032,And we have quite a few of them here in our city But going to local farmer's market and being able to buy directly to from Um from the consumer to the farmer where you know that they don't have to necessarily go through all those loopholes to be on the product shelves,0.98,1.0
38,en-US,630.3300095999999,11.459993599999999,But you trust it Exactly Yeah because because it's it's you know that person you have that relationship and they may not be in your local grocery store or they might not be at your local target or mass chain thing,0.98,1.0
39,en-US,642.0900352,19.3199616,But you do know that it's more of a natural thing because they you trust the people really Exactly Well the producer that brings me to like isn't it almost contradictory that something is mass produced and organic Not to say it can't be done but when I think organic and I think all natural like we talked about preservatives,0.97,1.0
40,en-US,661.7700351999999,15.5699712,they're sitting on a shelf right there If it's if it's organic let's be real It's going to go bad fairly quick because it's not going to have all the preservatives and whatever else that they put in things to make them last on the shelf for months at a time,0.97,1.0
41,en-US,677.6999936,15.8700032,So almost in my humble opinion I almost believe like the only way to really buy organically is to buy from small business and local business Right Like I don't think that's a term that companies I'm glad that they have that,0.98,1.0
42,en-US,694.5100288,16.169984,That verbiage and they have those hoops for them to jump through because otherwise companies would just use it for like you say they want that money so they're going to just use it profusely anywhere Right But if you really think about the term you can't really be organic if it's on the shelf sitting for this long,0.98,1.0
43,en-US,710.8599808,17.850060799999998,Right Um That you bring up a very good point Um On the other hand though I think we need to understand that Um the nature of preservatives because certain products especially if they're not water based you're not going to need as strong of a preservative system as you do with a water based product,1.0,1.0
44,en-US,728.9199616,10.8000256,But there's also concerns about if you have a product that Um if the lid is being opened and reopened and maybe wet hands are reaching in the jar to to put the product on the face you do have that,0.97,1.0
45,en-US,740.0200192,14.249984,It's a small risk but there's a risk nonetheless Um Our product like for example mascaras going in the eye area Um It's a risk nonetheless So in my personal opinion the only way to completely avoid preservatives is to make your products yourself,0.97,1.0
46,en-US,754.6599936,12.4200448,And not everybody Um is able to do that Not everybody wants to do that And there's also a lot of misconception about Um I've heard people say that well my product has coconut oil in it so it doesn't need a preservative or my product is vitamin E,0.98,1.0
47,en-US,767.0800383999999,15.869952,And that's Um and that's all it needs And unfortunately you know Um ingredients that are antifungal aren't and aren't necessarily antiviral aren't necessarily anti mold So Um there's unfortunately a lot of misinformation out there about preservatives and exactly what they do,0.98,1.0
48,en-US,784.3899904,23.9400448,Um And everything Uh has an expiration date Everything goes bad at some point in time The only thing Um that I've read that supposedly will never go bad or doesn't really go bad is honey Right So Um so I want to touch on another topic Um and this is your opinion Um and based on your knowledge and I know you from elsewhere so,0.99,1.0
49,en-US,808.3300352,17.1899904,I consider you fairly knowledgeable in your in this field What in your opinion is the most dangerous chemical being added to household cleaning products or to personal hygiene products And I ask that because I want to like almost create a buzz word for consumers like what do you look for,0.98,1.0
50,en-US,825.76,11.3100288,Right Um Unfortunately that's a really tough question because many of the most dangerous ingredients in products turn out to be ones that we didn't know were in the product in the first place and actually don't even show up on the label,0.99,1.0
51,en-US,837.5200255999999,15.719987199999998,So for example Um Johnsen's is currently settling multi-million dollar lawsuits over concerns about asbestos in talc powder Oh my gosh Wow Now you're not going to find asbestos on baby powder labels Um Asbestos has also been actually it's been Um it's been banned,0.98,1.0
52,en-US,853.8400256,13.110016,So it's you're not going to see that on a label Uh Asbestos has also been found in children's cosmetics from both Clairs and Justice Oh gee So when you're when you're looking at a label Um it's not just ingredients that you need to be looking for,0.95,1.0
53,en-US,866.9500416,18.5699328,It's it's where are we getting products from Um Uh And unfortunately you know when we're buying products from places like the Dollar Store or Clairs or Justice or whatever and we're looking at where these products are made and what type of environmental regulations and chemical regulations are in place Um it can get scary,0.98,1.0
54,en-US,885.5499775999999,13.9199488,So would you say instead of looking for a particular ingredient more so you should look for the manufacturer or the source of the product Well I think both are both are important but that's a very good point We also need to consider where our products are coming from,1.0,1.0
55,en-US,899.4699264,17.1900928,And Um Uh as far as a type of product Um that that's Uh one of the most dangerous products out there I think hair dyes and chemical hair straighteners Um formaldehyde coal tar There's a whole slew of chemicals in these products that are they're just not safe,0.99,1.0
56,en-US,917.6200192,9.630003199999999,Um Some products That's what I was really getting And like I know there's some products you do probably like I just don't use I don't think I don't mess with them And I would just You mess with it either,0.9,1.0
57,en-US,927.2800255999999,19.259904,And it's probably unfair to say across the board these products are always unsafe because for example you do have Hanah hair colors which are far safer products than your typical L'Oreal in the box Um So Um yeah I guess those two classes of chemicals hair dyes hair straighteners,0.99,1.0
58,en-US,946.9599744,18.7500544,Um Another class of chemicals that are product that typically has questionable ingredients is all of the feminine hygiene products all of your sprays and your wipes than anoxia all nine which is a spermicide that Uh can be present in in the wipes in the sprays the fragrance which can disturb the Um the balance of a delicate area,0.95,1.0
59,en-US,965.9799552,15.5700224,So all of those are and not to mention they're just they're just unnecessary Yeah they are And we're all women And we we hope to gather mostly women audience And I'm sure everybody's been to the Gián and they tell you you shouldn't use this doosh,0.97,1.0
60,en-US,982.0900352,18.5399296,You shouldn't use any of it The message the human body or Uh specifically the vagina is almost like a self-cleaning oven I like to And if you take care of it it will take care of itself Right Exactly And you touched a little bit on Um the fragrances and some of the feminine hygiene products but I've also noticed that,0.97,1.0
61,en-US,1000.6299647999999,18.7200512,there is a huge Um lot more people becoming very sensitive to fragrance And I read an article which was a little bit disturbing to me but Um in a Um health and wellness blog recently that more of these boutique studios are going to create their own fragrances and actually like spray it into the air,0.99,1.0
62,en-US,1019.3800192,10.6600448,Yes too Because a lot of these people that attend the studio they don't like the smell of like the locker room Right So they want something that smells a little bit fresher But I also know this can aggravate a lot of people's allergies,0.98,1.0
63,en-US,1030.040064,11.929907199999999,Right Can you touch base a little bit about some of the harmful effects of places like this or even like the casinos has been told that they've actually was spray something into the air It keeps people spinning more and more money,0.96,1.0
64,en-US,1042.24,21.9899904,Yes So Um that's an interesting thing that you touched upon There are companies that actually make fragrance and synthetic fragrance that can be pumped through the ventilation systems in public buildings casinos office buildings in the city Um So Um for for people with any type of skin problem I think the top two ingredients I suggest avoiding our synthetic fragrance,0.98,1.0
65,en-US,1064.2299904,14.099967999999999,And also Um am I the missing ingredient the method for Zaizen that we talked about Um the category fragrance even natural fragrance is sort of a catch all phrase because the FDA doesn't require companies to reveal the ingredients that make up fragrance,0.97,1.0
66,en-US,1078.9599232,17.0100736,Uh The ingredients don't have to go on the label because they're considered proprietary information or trade secrets Why We don't use any type of I don't use natural fragrance either Um So you won't see like watermelon natural fragrance or cucumber natural fragrance or whatever on our product labels because we pratik practice complete ingredient disclosure,0.99,1.0
67,en-US,1096.2400255999999,20.0998912,And if you're using a catch all phrase like that Um you're not practicing complete ingredient disclosure Uh So you have people with Uh multiple chemical sensitivity You have people with asthma You have people that just get migraines from fragrance Um Matter of fact Um I don't know if they still do but I believe the 36 district court still has a fragrance ban,1.0,1.0
68,en-US,1116.3399167999999,15.6300288,in place because there was a lawsuit a while back for a woman Uh from a woman that had fragrance sensitivity You had a lawsuit from Uh I can't remember It is ninety nine point five out of the radio station Um There was a lawsuit there from a woman that was had some Uh sensitivity to fragrance,0.97,1.0
69,en-US,1131.9799808,15.480012799999999,So it's a real issue It's recognized Um by Um it's legally it's recognized So it's a thing And people do have to do it My last job Um I was there for almost 11 years We air was a health insurance company,0.94,1.0
70,en-US,1147.4799616,24.6300672,They had posted throughout the building's Uh warnings about fragrance And you could be subject to Um disciplinary action or even termination if you were found to where we were explicitly told you cannot wear any fragrance anything that contains fragrance even down through the the hair products your hair spray or whatever is you using your hair to make your stay,0.98,1.0
71,en-US,1172.9800192,11.670015999999999,Um It can't smell you You don't know who because you don't And they never will reveal who it was And they don't have to But whoever it was it was a life or death situation obviously where they smelled this fragrance,0.96,1.0
72,en-US,1185.0400768,12.9599488,They would go on I believe was almost like seizure provoking Right It's interesting that you bring that up because there was a Uh situation Um a few years back Um There's a movie called Stinks called Stink the movie and it was made,0.97,1.0
73,en-US,1198.2099455999999,11.8501376,It's an interesting title But basically the whole movie started up because Um there was a man that Uh he lost his wife to breast cancer when his children were very young and he bought a pair of pajamas for his children from justice,0.99,1.0
74,en-US,1210.0600832,17.139916799999998,And when he opened them up the smell was just overpowering Oh yes Uh Yes Yeah And so there's a there's a section in that movie specifically about ax body spray that was a young man Um who did what they call challeng testing with his allergist trying to specifically pinpoint what it was that he was smelling at school,0.96,1.0
75,en-US,1227.2199679999999,18.9300736,It was causing him to go into anaphylactic shock Turns out it was specifically ax body spray anaphylactic shock Now what is that Anaphylactic shock is basically Um when you hear about people with Um peanut allergy Edges or Uh things like that that are that are where the airway is starting to close up it's very specific,0.97,1.0
76,en-US,1246.3899648,13.1700736,I'm not a doctor but that's my understanding of what anaphylactic shock is So Um this was somebody that had gone to the emergency room multiple times and the ban was put in place and the school told the students nobody can wear ax body spray,1.0,1.0
77,en-US,1259.6800512,18.149888,He was homeschooled for a while So his family sent him back to school And lo and behold the ax body spray somebody is using it So he's back in the emergency room And the company refused to tell the mother and the doctor what ingredients were in this fragrance so that they could figure out what specifically is causing,0.98,1.0

79,en-US,1301.139968,18.9299712,putting in this fragrance or this laundry detergent or Uh whatever else to make it smell like they used as a base for the fragrance So you're using something there which for which is used to kill something else To fragrance another product,0.97,1.0
80,en-US,1320.189952,16.6800384,Right Right I think my my main concern is Uh obviously with the you know Uh disease and allergens and whatnot but to me it's just a question of of honesty that I need to know especially if you're with the prevalence of allergies in our society,0.98,1.0
81,en-US,1337.0799104,12.120064,You need to know what's in the product If the skin is the largest organ in the body when it comes to food you can't have secret ingredients in food Yeah I'm not really sure why we're allowing secret ingredients Um in in fragrance,0.99,1.0
82,en-US,1349.740032,13.139968,But you're right Why Why why would this be a secret especially when like you said with the rise of allergies and and that sounds pretty dangerous if his air pass were closing or swelling Right And you can't breathe,0.98,1.0
83,en-US,1362.9100032,13.1100672,Right And it just I don't know It almost makes me wonder like is there some type of this brings me to my next question Is there some type of testing you can do on a product A person can do themself,1.0,1.0
84,en-US,1376.1999872,15.7200384,Like is there a lab or is there somewhere to could take a product to be like I just want to know what all this contains Uh There is but unfortunately it's very expensive Like for example in the stink movie Um the man that directed the movie and acted in the movie had the resources to have these pajamas tested to,0.98,1.0
85,en-US,1391.9200256,18.689945599999998,find out specifically what it was that was causing the stench and found out that was a flame retardant that had been banned years ago that was on these pajamas Um So Uh it is possible to do such things Unfortunately most of us don't have the resources to take a product and figure out,0.99,1.0
86,en-US,1411.5699711999998,18.270003199999998,Um There's a matter of fact there's Uh chemical testing laboratories right in our area Uh in the metro Detroit area But again Um for most folks it's going to be out of their out of their reach So then my question is is there a company that is doing these product testings for the consumer and at least putting it out there on,0.98,1.0
87,en-US,1429.9899904,13.3499904,the Internet that says here is the product we tested It shows that it has X amount of it And if so what is the name of that company so that our people who are listening audience can actually go there and do their own research,0.99,1.0
88,en-US,1443.8199296,15.2100864,So Um some websites that I would recommend or organizations I can recommend that have good information about what's in our products Um Now I should preface this by saying that unfortunately ingredients are changing all the time Formulations are changing all the time,0.99,1.0
89,en-US,1459.2099328,17.640038399999998,And what's considered dangerous and what isn't also can change over time was we get new information about products So rather than Um we do need to talk about specific ingredients but we also need to talk about resources to keep on checking you know what's on the labels what's considered dangerous what's banned in Europe what's permitted in the United,0.99,1.0
90,en-US,1476.8499712,24.719974399999998,States Um So I would suggest Uh safe safe cosmetics dot org Uh They have a Uh really Uh useful list of chemicals of concern And what types of products you will find them in Uh I can also suggest women's voices for the Earth Uh Another good resource for Um not or com Um women's voices for the earth,0.96,1.0
91,en-US,1501.5900159999999,25.6900096,I can't remember But if you Google women's voices for years you'll find Um you'll find them Uh And they're dealing with not just toxins in our personal care products but also the things we use everyday Like I had mentioned flame retardants in our furniture in in in Uh infant mattresses Um the Teflon Um the nonstick coatings that are on panels Um things like,0.97,1.0
92,en-US,1527.2800256,20.329984,that nail polish Uh just kind of a Um wrap around sort of information about toxins in and what we're exposed to Okay And I wanted to touch on earlier when you you were saying that the really only surefire way to make sure you're not ingesting and buying ingesting people are not,0.98,1.0
93,en-US,1547.9200767999998,15.77984,I'm not just referring to eating Ingesting means whatever you put on your skin whatever you insert into your body Right Um Is to make it yourself And I understand everybody doesn't have that type of time But Um for instance Stephanie makes her own deodorant,0.99,1.0
94,en-US,1563.9699455999998,18.840063999999998,I make my own laundry soap and I use the word soap because Um to refer to as mildness Um in detergent implies chemicals in my hair And you have an entire line so of products So is there anything if someone wanted to start,0.98,1.0
95,en-US,1583.7599744,19.5900416,What products what would be like the easiest go to or the most common product or the most easy is made product that you could say I think you you can start here Um Deodorant is probably one of the one of the more simple products to make because the ingredients for deodorant are easily accessible,0.98,1.0
96,en-US,1603.3500159999999,10.979942399999999,And it's not a water based product So you you know especially if you're using it Um at home Uh you're not and you're not putting it on a shelf you're probably not going to have to worry about preservatives and pleats while you're talking about deodorant,0.99,1.0
97,en-US,1614.3299584,17.9400704,Please speak on deodorant Um There's a couple of different Um There's more than a couple actually But the main things to be concerned about in deodorant are the aluminum compounds that Uh temporarily plug the sweat ducts to Um to reduce Uh that That's where the term antiperspirant comes in,0.98,1.0
98,en-US,1632.5100544,10.3799808,So most of your like the deodorant that Stephanie makes the odor and I make the deodorant you're going to be getting from a farmer's market Um they're not going to have antiperspirants in them And that's where those aluminum compounds are coming from,0.97,1.0
99,en-US,1643.2199679999999,23.3700352,It's been associated with Alzheimer's disease Um And then you have Um most of your Uh deodorants from the grocery store whatnot have synthetic fragrance in them Um So those are generally the two Um two main ingredients in deodorant that are questionable are aluminum and Um and the fragrance compounds,0.99,1.0
100,en-US,1666.5900032,18.0900864,And Uh and again I'm not a doctor This is just my own research I don't claim to be a doctor Um but a lot of breast cancer is found in the upper quadrant of the breast So some people have concerns that Um the deodorant and the ingredients and deodorant and plugging the sweat ducts are contributing to that,0.98,1.0
101,en-US,1685.1600383999998,11.990015999999999,The American Cancer Society says all of that's bunk There's no connection whatsoever I'm just I'm just throwing that out there Not yeah I'm not a doctor You can go look up the information yourself but Uh you don't have to be a doctor,0.96,1.0
102,en-US,1697.1599872,17.939968,We respect you You have a wealth of knowledge People always say I'm not a doctor but you've done your research Right You care You're passionate enough about the subject matter Is that right Well I respect your opinion and I think Uh the listening audience will glean enough information that they find helpful,0.98,1.0
103,en-US,1715.1099904,15.0199296,Thank you And that's one reason why I started creating my own deodorant when my dad was diagnosed with stage four cancer of the lymph nodes that the only products that in my shelf or in my cosmetic area that were not natural was deodorant and toothpaste,0.98,1.0
104,en-US,1730.429952,15.800115199999999,And after dealing with all of his the two years of him struggling with cancer and passing away I decided that I wanted to try the natural deodorants But most of the ones that I saw on the shelves Um that you would find at your local stores they just weren't holding up for the amount of exercise that I do,0.99,1.0
105,en-US,1746.2398976,18.1501952,So I created my own and I'm perfectly fine I tell people all the time your body is meant to sweat So the antiperspirants stuff that is actually preventing your body from doing its natural thing of detoxify Um I just wanted something that after you know a long day of me working out of training my clients I'm nuts ricking,0.97,1.0
106,en-US,1764.9000448,13.44,right Um at the end of the day So that's what I went to create my own Um And something that would be able to withstand like the heat and everything else when I'm doing my outdoor hikes and everything So that's my main reason why we picked were the more natural,0.97,1.0
107,en-US,1778.8801024,15.479807999999998,Um But I always tell people all the time your body is meant to sweat So you're preventing it from doing its natural thing to cool itself off and to get all of those toxins out of your system What are some other products that are really easy to make at home even if it's Um like cleansing products,0.98,1.0
108,en-US,1794.3900159999998,17.7600512,I know a lot of I spoke to someone earlier today and she was mentioning that she uses method but some of the cleaning products she just has a hard time Still Um getting something sparkly clean is also still go towards that Um towards that bleach or the harsher chemicals as she's like it's just not Gidi like my toilet was,0.97,1.0
109,en-US,1812.1500672,12.119859199999999,clean enough or it's just not getting my countertops clean enough Or I feel like my Um same thing with laundry Like I'm just not getting that whiteners I keep arguing with my husband about hey stop using the bleach that's in this house,0.99,1.0
110,en-US,1824.2699263999998,17.4901248,Like first of all it shouldn't be here But Uh I understand that somehow I got into our house I would stop using it on our whites' We have natural lawn Uh laundry soap from my co-host René's But how do you what is something that you can add to your products or what is something that you can make and your,0.95,1.0
111,en-US,1841.7600512,16.9199616,own That's a natural way of of getting that household items a little bit nicer sparkly clean Um I think a key concept to remember is we could probably all do better to just to simplify Most of us are just using too many products Um so we could simplify,0.98,1.0
112,en-US,1858.6800128,24.5700608,That's going to reduce the toxic load in our homes Um Oxygene bleach which is Um Uh a non chlorine Um sodium polycarbonate basically Um can be added to a homemade laundry product to boost the cleaning ability And it's also color safe Um So basically the Um oxygen Uh the combination of the water in the product Um that's what's going to get Um that's what's going to,0.98,1.0
113,en-US,1883.31008,21.480038399999998,Get things clean so you can use that as an alternative to chlorine bleach It's fairly inexpensive Um Another alternative is you can get like Uh you have those you know those Dr. Bronner's soaps in the big bottle Um You can use kind of a concentrated soap base to make Um your Um you know your all-purpose cleaner and your your bathroom cleaner or,0.97,1.0
114,en-US,1904.7901184,16.6699008,whatnot I will say this Um unfortunately when you're dealing with things like soap scum Uh when you're dealing with things like rust stains Um sometimes you know You need a particular type of cleaner for a particular job I'm not a huge fan of the water and vinegar cleans everything,0.99,1.0
115,en-US,1921.7000448,14.999961599999999,I just I don't think it does You know from a chemical standpoint there's certain types of stains that you're not going to be able to to fix with with vinegar and water And that's a common complaint that I hear is that gee national natural cleaning products would be great but a lot of them don't work,1.0,1.0
116,en-US,1937.0600448,13.980057599999999,And honestly that's that's a very valid concern So we need to just do a little bit more homework to figure out here's the specific kind of stain I'm dealing with What can I use as an alternative to a harsher product on the market Um to to get rid of that stain,1.0,1.0
117,en-US,1951.2500223999998,16.5699584,Yeah Um Yeah You I wanted to touch on what you just said Like a lot of people say the natural products just don't get as clean Um But it's almost like a vicious cycle too Like the soaps we use create those soap scars because of the harsh detergent and chemicals that are in them,0.96,1.0
118,en-US,1968.1998847999998,18.240102399999998,That's why they leave behind that residue So then you have to talk to people about possibly changing the soap they use You know that's that's a harder discussion to have with people than you think getting people to change their soap or tell them that hey your soap is really harsh and it's probably the reason why your skin,0.98,1.0
119,en-US,1986.4399872,11.029913599999999,is so dry which is why you have to use this lotion and this How about you just change this this and this And that could probably remedy this this and this Right And they don't want to have those discussions,1.0,1.0
120,en-US,1997.479936,17.0100736,People are creatures of habit I mean they just they want what they want Right It's almost like Um Uh I notice with my detergent or I'm sorry with my laundry soap I had to almost educate people also And I had one friend tell me why I didn't see any soots when I used it,0.96,1.0
121,en-US,2014.8799488,14.3099904,Well certs and laundry soap or laundry detergent That's a sudsy An agent doesn't necessarily mean your clothes are clean It's just something that makes the water soap up Big companies know this That's why they add it to the laundry detergent,0.96,1.0
122,en-US,2029.2800512,12.7199232,Like even with your your hair care products like they have the now the Um the natural shampoo or the know poo shampoo And are people saying well I'm so used to having that sudsy feeling or when I walk that's how I know my hair is clean,0.95,1.0
123,en-US,2042.2098944,21.2400128,So I will continue to add more product until I get that sudsy feeling Um And I think that's that like you said that misconception that we have I talked to a gentleman that owns a laundromat and he even told me those subscene agencies Um they're basically the same things that everybody's blown bubbles before the kid write that stuff,0.95,1.0
124,en-US,2064.0800768,14.1299712,That's what the servicing agents and a lot of detergents are You wouldn't wash with that You wouldn't consider yourself clean if you watched it with bubbles I mean it looks pretty and makes bubbles Yeah that's it So Uh that's why I see it,0.95,1.0
125,en-US,2078.2399488,12.1499648,I consider you very knowledgeable It's almost like an education You have to give people first and then get them to change their attitudes toward Exactly A lot of the products you touched base Uh and use a little bit about the misconception,0.95,1.0
126,en-US,2090.3899136,13.6802304,I think the other misconception I hear all the time is that it's so expensive to go natural or organic Um and not realizing that a lot of these things you can make on your own or you can get it from a local store like yourself Um right in the city of Detroit,0.99,1.0
127,en-US,2104.7599104,17.880064,You can support your local small businesses where it's not going to be as expensive as something at the mass retailer sites Um Same thing like I was talking about food and the local farmer market You could still go organic without having to necessarily pay the high prices that you would see on your normal grocery store shelves because they,0.98,1.0
128,en-US,2122.6399744,12.9898496,have to go through all those extra steps in order to get that quote unquote label of organic Well Ellen touched on a point earlier when she talked about how is Johnson and Johnson correct They have the lawsuit against them for the south powder,0.98,1.0
129,en-US,2136.620032,19.109887999999998,Well the most effective form of talc powder Well because talc powder is nothing But since that's what why it becomes the teleporter they like the Cornstarch That is the most basic Yeah Form or arrowroot powder Right And it will give you the sense it won't have a cent to it,0.92,1.0
130,en-US,2155.7299199999998,21.5001088,But that's how how Um I don't want to say brainwashed but how people have become programed into thinking If it doesn't smell good I'm not clean When cornstarch will probably even give you more effective results then tell me how you can use essential oils if you don't have any issues with the and the essential oils,0.96,1.0
131,en-US,2177.2300288,14.2299136,And a lot of them will have other properties I mean so there's other ways that you can still get that fragrance if you feel like you need to have that fragrance And I love my essential oils without necessarily going through the the the fragrance oils or the quote unquote natural fragrance oils,0.98,1.0
132,en-US,2191.4599424,17.6402432,What you touched on earlier you don't really know what those items are because it's a proprietary blend Right Um It's something that there's Uh a sense of smell is extremely powerful Um It has the ability to evoke memories from many years ago,0.97,1.0
133,en-US,2209.1298816,20.8300032,Exactly And and recreate experiences in our brains So Um we We may associate you know clean laundry with the smell of tide or fabric softener or Um it's something we've been maybe we've been smelling since we were little children You know Uh the smell of pine sol the smell of simple green all of these things that we associate maybe we,0.98,1.0
134,en-US,2229.9598848,11.52,associate that in our head with When mom would clean the house on every Saturday morning mom got up at eight and she spent all this time And when you smell that you remember that you know so those things are I don't want to discount that,0.99,1.0
135,en-US,2241.4798848,21.1699712,Those are those are very powerful But Um also you know like the saying goes when you know better you do better Yes Um And We need to remember too that like Um essential oils can be used to send a product but we're not going to get the strength of scent like you usually do with Um you know if I make my,0.99,1.0
136,en-US,2262.649856,18.0299776,soap with Uh an essential lavender essential oil It's not the same thing is lavender from bath and body works And it's not an overpowering scent And I think that's what I like about it is that once you go natural you start to when you start smelling products like you talked about Bath and Bodyworks when I started going more,0.96,1.0
137,en-US,2280.6798335999997,9.6401408,natural Um I remember going someplace at a friend's house and they had the bath and bodyworks soap Uh And I you know just use that And as I was driving home I was like oh my gosh what is that Right,0.96,1.0
138,en-US,2290.3400447999998,15.36,And I kept trying to figure out like what is that really strong like lavender smell And it was almost making me a little bit nauseous And then I realized as I was driving it was my hands The first thing I wanted to do was go home and quickly rinse and wash my hands because it just was too,0.96,1.0
139,en-US,2305.7299456,10.7401216,got staying power Yeah it's just too strong And I think a lot of people like that's what weight gain is always talks about like oh it's the last three days long or whatever The commercial is about the staying power of of the scent,0.94,1.0
140,en-US,2316.7700992,15.739904,But the verses are funny The commercials are funny But at the same time it's like it's not a it's not a good sign I mean it's not it's not good that it lasted that long Like what is it that that is in that product that is making that staying power like a week long,0.96,1.0
141,en-US,2332.5200384,14.189977599999999,Like I shouldn't smell my gain you know T-shirt and be like Um still as I gained three weeks later Right Right After you sweat it in it and everything goes exactly like oh I still smell fresh like no no I have to,0.91,1.0
142,en-US,2347.5800064,15.900057599999998,Um Even though it isn't a personal care or a cleaning product I think I need to bring up candles Um because if synthetic fragrance is Um unhealthy for us to put on our skin I think setting it on fire is probably a good idea either,0.99,1.0
143,en-US,2365.5800832,15.629926399999999,Um So yes scented candles I think are probably something else that really needs to go I agree with you on that I agree with you too and especially if you have a paraffin candle So you're setting a petroleum based product on fire that also contains synthetic fragrance and then it's wafting through the air,0.98,1.0
144,en-US,2381.8999808,9.8701312,Um Again it's not a cleaning product It's not a personal care product but it's something that is keeping products all about it Yeah Yeah And we made a lot of putting our candles Like I said our audience is a lot of them are females,0.92,1.0
145,en-US,2391.7701119999997,17.7299456,I mean people like the smell of the ambiance of a candle candles create I mean I just love the way it looks when I'm lighting my candle in the morning for my meditation It's a nice calming effect But at the same time as it causing any kind of problems on the long timer as I'm zoning out am,0.96,1.0
146,en-US,2409.5000575999998,16.1998848,I actually harming my body in the process of me going into that Zearfoss State Well that's awesome Can you talk a little bit about your products and what are some of your biggest top sellers Sure Um So we do a complete line of cleaning and houseware products Uh personal care and cosmetics,0.97,1.0
