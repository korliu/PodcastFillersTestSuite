3,en-US,59.6300032,24.8699968,What would you say Oh God The hardest question to start with I mean I would say I'm a songwriter Um That's where everything started with I write songs and animals and author Uh It came kind of hand in hand And then I do a lot of things kind of to support being a songwriter and an author,0.95,1.0
4,en-US,84.5,19.5299968,But I would say those are the main things I do I also have a podcast I Uh I run workshops and Uh I teach yoga Uh songwriting and my books are my main focus Yeah that's so amazing And I'm just so inspired by all the things that you're exploring with your work,0.98,1.0
5,en-US,104.53999999999999,17.9099968,But Uh I feel your focus or your roots really are in music Um Is that right Yeah I mean it's so hard to say because it changes every hour and every season But Um what's been really nice is that I've been writing books now for for many years,0.99,1.0
6,en-US,122.45999359999999,17.9000064,And what I found is a really nice way to kind of divide the year So I used to work on an album for you know pretty much a year actually And when I have released a record Oh my God the last thing I want to do is to just go back and make another record I am like,0.96,1.0
7,en-US,140.3699968,14.129996799999999,completely empty I have said everything I wanted to say on those songs I worked so hard on it so that I do shall we say like OK cool I'm just going to be an author now And then I go off and I write the book for Um half a year or a year,0.96,1.0
8,en-US,154.9500032,9.299993599999999,And when I have published a book the last thing I want to do is write another book because I'm like I said everything I wanted to say So then I'm super inspires you to go back and make a record,0.98,1.0
9,en-US,164.2599936,15.740006399999999,So I think I'm using them as as ways to also stay motivated with both both things and to have like one focus at a time so I can review will the other part of me I think so Like a creativity circle basically,0.96,1.0
10,en-US,180.12,17.9100032,Exactly Yes Yeah Because I think definitely Um writing music makes me a better author and studying literature and learning how to write better definitely makes me a better songwriter too So yeah it's like the circle of the circle of life,1.0,1.0
11,en-US,198.5700096,15.2999808,Yeah that's true That's awesome Um And what I really do like about your work Um for example your Instagram posts is that it you know there's this symbiosis between music and poetry And I feel like you can't really divide the two,0.99,1.0
12,en-US,214.6199936,14.2499968,Do you agree with that Um I mean it's a good question I think maybe at some point I would have agreed with that But now Um I see a big part of what I do is writing music for other artists,0.98,1.0
13,en-US,229.1399936,16.1700096,Writing for another artist It's very it's very like Um mathematical What is on the charts What are they looking for How how are we going to write this song so that it fits this kind of Um structure and you know this genre and this playlists,0.96,1.0
14,en-US,245.82000639999998,18.780006399999998,And I love that too But it's very different than I would say That kind of process for me is not so poetic Um But then maybe like actually the magic happens when you can take that kind of mainstream process and hear the poetry in it,0.99,1.0
15,en-US,266.15999999999997,13.2600064,Um So yeah maybe you need a little bit of poetry in everything Maybe you're right Yeah And I can totally understand what you just said about Uh one being maybe a bit more of a profession for you So when you write songs for others,0.99,1.0
16,en-US,279.85000959999996,14.959999999999999,But yeah Um I feel like when you write poetry for yourself it's probably more of a soul thing Right Um But I mean not saying that you're not pouring your soul into the work you do I guess it's just Um a different sort of Um purpose behind it,0.97,1.0
17,en-US,295.1700224,24.9599744,Yeah I mean I think Um that I could I could talk for hours about this but I think Uh the hard thing when you're trying to build a career on something that is so soulful as writing poetry or writing music or writing fiction or whatever Um you you do lose a little bit of like poetic magic,0.97,1.0
18,en-US,320.12999679999996,13.8599936,When you make a business plan and you make a marketing plan and you make a digital strategy and you create an ad strategy and like it becomes you know you have to turn it into a profession at some point if you want it to be,0.96,1.0
19,en-US,335.1600128,19.4700032,Um But it is those things even now I've done this for so many years and I have to remind myself sometimes I'm like hey you're you're supposed to just like live your dream you know And then I always go back to reading the books that I fell in love with when I was younger and listening to the records,0.99,1.0
20,en-US,354.630016,13.6399616,that I loved when I was younger till I could remind myself of oh it's about you know it's supposed to be about poetry and not just a business plan Mm hmm Yeah And I think both of them are valid,0.96,1.0
21,en-US,368.2799872,18.780006399999998,You know I mean both the business aspect and the authenticity aspect I think both have their place for sure and for sure Yeah Yeah But if it's your profession I think maybe there is a different kind of expectation towards your art and your creativity,0.97,1.0
22,en-US,387.15000319999996,21.3299968,So what did you do when you ever get stuck in a rut creatively What inspires you to keep creating Um I find inspiration I mean God everywhere It's such a boring answer but really everywhere from my own life from the people I meet from what I'm going through what I see my friends go through,0.99,1.0
