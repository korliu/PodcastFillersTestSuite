1,en-US,34.759996799999996,27.75,Mm hmm Thanks a lot Cornelia for the invitation Uh I've been here for quite a while due to COVID 19 and the various lockdowns Uh in both the UK and to Greece Um and from Greece But as you said I live and work in Uh Edinburgh working in the Edinburgh College of Art for a number of years to say decades,0.95,1.0
2,en-US,62.72,24.2999936,And Um I'm in the school of architecture landscape architecture But my focus is in culture geography and Uh theory I'm I'm in a small there as you say as well I'm quite a long time in Athens and I'm doing research here as well which is related to with Uh my work Uh on collaborative practices in emerging networks,0.95,1.0
3,en-US,87.01999359999999,23.8800128,And I'm looking at solidarity networks here in Uh Greece in the last six years and Uh how they merged and Uh slurries but also conflicts differences that happen within et cetera et cetera online offline Um presences Uh So that's what I've been doing Uh during the lockdown as well,0.96,1.0
4,en-US,112.3000064,19.759987199999998,OK thanks a lot So we are having this conversation in the context of our research project Creative Commons And before we are going to have a look at some of the projects you have been working with in the last few years I would like to ask you to explain how you are using the concept of the commons,0.97,1.0
5,en-US,132.0700032,22.1500032,What does it mean to you as a cinematographer So for me it's very much important that the specialty how you contain space what it means space within this concept of the commons and to Uh the idea of shared spaces how people come and communally Uh work together in order to create space by space,0.99,1.0
6,en-US,154.23999999999998,33.8700032,Obviously I don't mean Um just in physical location but it can be something more abstract more cognitive like how knowledge creates these shared space how you share Uh for example learning practices for instance Um So what SÃ¡mi commons is not Uh how Uh Jess Elinor Ostrom and this tradition Um described Uh the concept as a pool of resources Um but rather is Uh I'm more interested,0.94,1.0
7,en-US,188.1100032,31.5599872,in relationality in the idea of relationships how through relationships Uh we create this shared space is that to be Um in common struggles and resistances Um as we've seen in with examples in Uh later years through let's say the movement of the squares here in in Greece or in Spain the movement of indignados Um but it can be also Uh commons in the,0.97,1.0
8,en-US,219.6699904,23.490022399999997,reference of non-indigenous I said Uh in my own work I've been looking as I said earlier collaborative practices in emerging networks And when I started this ethnographic field work I Um entirely looked on online Um communities or those that they use digital to put it this way,0.93,1.0
9,en-US,244.2700032,28.759987199999998,And there it was Uh I encounter Uh ways of those communities of art practitioners particularly through new media artists Uh did celebrities etc. using Um Uh the digital domain and sharing Uh this knowledge with you know like open Uh open source free Um you know free knowledge etc etc.,0.94,1.0
10,en-US,273.03999999999996,22.440012799999998,So yes for Commons is about Um this idea of relationality and space OK great So I think we should now have a look Uh Uh more specifically at some of the projects you have been working with and one of them is Uh located in Colombia is the collective plateau here in Medellin,0.94,1.0
11,en-US,296.0499968,27.249996799999998,And I would like you to describe a little bit the work of this collective Um exam if you look on the website There's different ways that they described this way themselves And again it's in relation to how to translate and communicate who you are who you are in the Um Uh in the right Uh audience in a sense,0.96,1.0
12,en-US,323.3200128,19.919974399999997,So it is a nonprofit organization but it's also a platform and it's also a community and is a space as well Um And Uh so it's multiple ways to explain what it is Um It Uh started in the early 2000s Uh by two people,0.96,1.0
13,en-US,344.4400128,27.3299712,Um I would say Uh Lynam Uh Mitzie and Uh Alexander and Uh Korea Uh They're a couple So as I say Evros started as Um Um a love project or a project that reflected their love So very much is about care And it's very important to Uh talk about care just from the very beginning of the tour through,0.91,1.0
14,en-US,372.15999999999997,27.630003199999997,Obviously it grew and now it has around 13 Uh people who are in the very core of Um the organization We talk Uh in this in this Um from this aspect of the organization but as well it includes Uh various programs within And that means different communities of users makers producers and Uh again users,0.99,1.0
15,en-US,401.049984,31.140019199999998,Um So they are children and youth from the nearby neighborhoods Uh They are Uh young Uh artists and designers Um They are local people Uh They are people from their dispersed network of collaborators across Latin America and beyond Latin America So myself I'm considered to be Um a close Uh collaborator from the wider network in the sense that I'm outside Uh Colombia in Latin America in,0.96,1.0
16,en-US,432.1900032,17.759999999999998,that sense Um So yes as I said this started in the early 2000s There is a space So Landreau has its own building Uh which is a very very vibrant is a vibrant space is a locus for creation and creation,0.96,1.0
17,en-US,450.57996799999995,30.130022399999998,And what attracted me from the very beginning is that when it looked through their website Um they had to Um keep concerts that Um The described and explain how those two concepts relate with the work they do He said when Vivier and went concer which translates in English as good Uh lives and good knowledge and in the very wider translation or,0.89,1.0
18,en-US,480.7799808,31.1100416,free translation is the closest to the commons and common knowledge and commons as a as a communal well-being So where does the concept come from From from when we were It has a history I assume right One of these years Uh comes Uh from indigenous Um Uh people in Ecuador first and then even Um in the nearby countries like Colombia and Bolivia,0.93,1.0
19,en-US,512.2899967999999,27.480012799999997,And what specifically has been used Um in Uh Ecuador And Uh and it comes from Sumac USA which means Uh how to think Um Uh for a good life Um It is Um an ethnic It's now been used even in the Constitution It has been recognized Uh since the early 2010s,0.92,1.0
20,en-US,539.9500287999999,26.2199296,And Uh likewise in Bolivia So it is recognized in the Constitution as well This idea of good lives and it has Uh principles So in a sense we can say it's subsid between and Kozmo vision to Um anarchical Um or Um code or a code of practice or even a code of conduct,0.91,1.0
21,en-US,566.2899712,21.420032,We could say so And the Marquise has 13 principles which is how to know to Uh Uh eat how to not to dance how to not Uh to dream how to know how to work et cetera et cetera Uh But what is important is this and this is Um I would say,0.96,1.0
22,en-US,588.7699968,29.490022399999997,Somehow the difference with Uh the way we describe the Commons from the Western perspective which is very anthropocentric Uh and if we see specifically the Commons as described by any rostrum Uh that it's actually a pool of resources that physical state space like nature is a set of resources Uh that could be served together between us as a group let's say,0.95,1.0
23,en-US,618.56,26.0100096,the commoners It is that the people act upon human beings act upon these resources which is in this case nature whereas in the case of when Visine and Smuxi it is that there is an equilibrium Uh and not differentiation between human beings not humans and nature that all have the same rights and all they are in the course,0.95,1.0
24,en-US,644.5700095999999,22.110003199999998,of dialog So there is not somebody who Uh octopod basically but together we act So this is a very interesting because when we see the way this is translated it's in the case of Black Lazarro how can we translate something that includes human beings not humans and nature,0.96,1.0
25,en-US,668.0300543999999,21.4499328,In their case for example they see technology and the code the code in a sense in programing as being in constant dialog with Uh those that they use it So the code has exactly the same rights and the same Uh Uh presence in that Uh sort of assemblage,0.95,1.0
26,en-US,689.5399936,23.8799872,We're talking even about assemblages here I very much and nature is very much a part of that of what they do either by using let's say principles again from permaculture for example or beyond that going back into indigenous understandings of what nature may mean in something like an organization like that,0.97,1.0
27,en-US,714.3799808,25.260032,So this is very interesting and obviously pixmap A lot of my Uh interest in doing my fieldwork with them What I'm particularly interested in is that Um that the principles Uh stem from from indigenous people And Um I'm interested And of course I see a lot of attraction in that,0.96,1.0
28,en-US,739.6400128,20.709939199999997,And there's also Um one could say some sort of maybe romanticism about that How can this really be applied to our modern Uh Uh technologized and urban societies in a meaningful way Yeah This is a very very good question and a good man,0.98,1.0
29,en-US,760.3699712,28.620032,Thank you so much for that because Uh the other thing that Uh Uh can happen with concepts like when the fear Um that has been Uh in the last 10 years Uh Uh became very very popular Uh Uh across Latin America and outside of Latin America is Uh to be related with Um a Queensland to extractive is capitalism Uh which is extractive is the knowledge,0.94,1.0
30,en-US,789.2600319999999,32.009983999999996,And within that includes the romanticization of those concepts that we take those concepts for granted and we try to apply them in completely different Um environments and outside of where they really originated and with and for which reason So Uh thinking about indigenous Uh communities in Um in Ecuador Colombia but also across the Amazon in Latin America included Uh Brazil is that,0.98,1.0
31,en-US,821.2700159999999,25.7099776,these people live within nature and not only that are Uh currently are Uh being considered as the ones responsible and safeguarding biodiversity And basically where we are with a natural system particularly really through this so-called climate change Um situation we live in its impact,0.93,1.0
32,en-US,847.340032,29.6999936,So getting these Uh principles out of this context could have a negative impact So when we asked Uh for instance by Israel OK how do you consider yourselves Uh taking these principles and what do you do with them Uh in a completely different environment Um literally and metaphorically Uh what Uh they said is that it is of it's clear to them that they cannot,0.97,1.0
33,en-US,877.6699904,21.0400256,Uh say Uh claim Uh a Uh legacy of these principles of these principles really are where they are Where they came from From Marquise but what they brought through is these urban context trying to translate the principles into the everydayness of an urban context,0.92,1.0
34,en-US,898.9500416,26.429952,And this is what they brought us to them and thinking also Uh in a Uh reference to Uh Uh so Um open source that if we say open source is a knowledge as well that you add definite And indeed what sequence is interesting with Uh some Marquise also comes from a specific environment themselves the region's population,0.92,1.0
35,en-US,925.7400319999999,23.549951999999998,Uh People Uh expect adaptation and expect that things could change but adapt it without losing its original Uh entity and Uh and meaning But at the same time is an open source Uh code of practice If we can call it the with our own Uh whosay terms,0.92,1.0
36,en-US,950.1599744,34.8499968,So yes going back to your Uh Uh question plateau through what offered to that was to Uh reread Uh the principles and try to adapt it to the everyday myths of an urban environment I think it would be Uh interesting to Here about one specific example how how it is applied in Um in their context or in the in their work and what,0.91,1.0
37,en-US,985.0300416,23.339929599999998,they are actually doing It's not clear yet the idea Uh Just give me a second Um with work Um If if you don't mind to Um get into Uh to see the principles Uh give a second and then read it And I'll explain how that has been Uh translated,0.94,1.0
38,en-US,1009.1500543999999,25.589964799999997,Uh What I think maybe they don't need to say here Uh is Um that during the lockdown or during the COVID 19 Uh and because it couldn't Uh visit Uh the space through the building and do work from there and in a way not to lose that momentum but also to be together as a group they decided to Uh work as a team online,0.95,1.0
39,en-US,1035.160064,30.419865599999998,and read Uh for 13 weeks the certain principle So each week they picked one of the principals Um Uh individually then came together in a meeting and Uh Uh presented Sather this Uh individual interpretation of the principle and then Um merged together This Deursen approaches into their own as a group Uh interpretation of Um its principle,0.93,1.0
40,en-US,1065.7299456,25.8300928,So they did a process of what I call and sync with others all the way to a t w o which goes beyond the do it with others The devil which is something that you do is something that you think collectively and this is very apparent in the Uh original Sumac Quazi or Gwenview principles that the indigenous Um groups,0.9,1.0
41,en-US,1091.5600384,16.9199616,when they came up with this Uh code Uh it was about thinking collectively So this is the one thing that you can say as a methodology is an interpretation of Flatlanders way of how they work that they work collectively but also they think collectively,0.97,1.0
42,en-US,1108.9599488,23.7500416,So before let's say decided or the project is a process of thinking and reflecting Um on the project of how they will Uh deliver the deliverables So I will take an example here Uh Give me a second And I think it will be no hard to work at Clutterham through,0.95,1.0
43,en-US,1132.8700416,24.2699264,And this is the way they separate Um the principle of how to work how to know how to work So the professional work at Flatlander teaches us more often than not to leave with others to listen to understand the collective to think from the collective to leave individual egos and to understand the trust in others also resides in,0.97,1.0
44,en-US,1157.139968,30.640025599999998,trusting oneself So if I want to translate that Um into how the Uh Translate in practice this first part of reinterpretation of the principle know how to work is that by listening to listen to me active listening So the use this Uh methodology that it comes as well from the nonviolence communication Uh that it is before you speak you need to,0.92,1.0
45,en-US,1187.7799936,20.5499392,ask to have this Um Uh to train yourself to be an active listener to let the other person Uh have the space to express and reflect And then you speak upon and you Um sir Uh Why do you have understood from what you've heard,0.95,1.0
46,en-US,1208.7199744,24.150015999999997,So it's a process and a methodology that needs quite a lot of Uh Uh whosay time Uh It's very much about time but also Uh space and space in this case is an abstract in the abstract to let space either to feel trusted to speak Uh Um from the heart,0.97,1.0
47,en-US,1232.9699328,16.7600128,If we can say so And the other one that it is interesting is to think from the collective what it means to think from the collective It is again through trust Um Um Um that you are first as I said you let the other speak and you listen,0.96,1.0
48,en-US,1249.9100672,28.709888,But also you collectively Uh think through So even the principal says I said it was a work of collective listening and collective Uh work Collective work here Uh goes back into Uh another Uh indigenous Uh word that's very much used Um in Uh this part of Latin America in Colombia Ecuador Bolivia is minga,0.96,1.0
49,en-US,1279.1300096,22.3299584,Minga Uh means communal work that imagine the violence that in one day and month that come together to collectively work in constructing Uh the house of one of the members In the case of Um Latoyia that translates that the collectively work in the protest,0.93,1.0
50,en-US,1302.0199936,18.1500928,So in the case of the work I've been doing with them the ethnography two and one member of this ecosystem So we decided to work around the idea of cultural commons and we ran a series of workshops in the past four years,0.96,1.0
51,en-US,1320.7399424,16.8000512,So this so Uh they are now is a collective work of the thirty people Somebody is responsible for that demonstration and for the financing of the you know how you the secretarial work Somebody else is responsible for the podcast's,0.95,1.0
52,en-US,1337.7800192,24.0300032,Somebody else is responsible for the Um editing and the curatorial work And we do through a series of Uh meetings in order to decide how to develop its project So it is quite a lot of collective work and collective So this is to think from the collective is quite a lot of collective thinking,0.99,1.0
53,en-US,1363.8499328,22.9700608,Um So this is one way to describe a couple of things that happens Uh within two Ansaru OK thank you And Um I also see in Uh the text you have published on them There has been some radio sessions The radio seems to be like one of their favorite media outlets,0.95,1.0
54,en-US,1388.2299392,21.7100288,Um Can you tell a little bit about these radio sessions Are they available online Could we listen to them Yes First of all they're available You can listen to them there Uh in Spanish however that haven't been Uh transcribed Um I cannot say with certainty but I think there is an idea of having a transcript,0.96,1.0
55,en-US,1411.6999168,32.6100992,Uh At some point Uh these are Uh OK Why Uh podcasts Because is a very easy way to Uh Um Uh have to disseminate this information to a wider audience and also to Uh add to have the Rackley Uh the discussion from Uh those involved in the process instead of an interpretation of writing a paper or writing a documentation of what has to be said here and,0.96,1.0
56,en-US,1444.310016,30.990028799999997,there Whereas the podcasts are there to So exactly what has been discussed in the moment and podcasts have been used in various Um projects For example as I said in the workshops I Um participated or Ecodesign and Cohran with Uh others from the time Uh we had a series of podcast as well Um in the form of Uh interviewing each other,0.96,1.0
57,en-US,1475.5400703999999,23.1798784,So it is interesting as well And I'm sorry I'm just putting a parenthesis here to your question and I'll go back to your question that if I speak about the ethnography I I work with them I originally when I first met them I had indeed Uh use Uh tools from Uh ethnographic tools Um then slower slower,0.96,1.0
58,en-US,1498.8199935999999,24.150015999999997,We moved to Uh collaborative models Um using sort of collaborative ethnography What I Um also called a peer to peer ethnography and this is a term originated from is open source simple doleac when Nancy and Orianna Persico But anyway I'm not going to go to my step to that,0.93,1.0
59,en-US,1523.3299456,27.960115199999997,And later in that we Um translate this term to person to person rather than a peer to peer suza person to person or Uh ethnography And lately we call it alliances And this is basically to Uh refer specifically equity into decolonized the knowledge that ethnography itself comes from a very colonizing Uh background history,0.92,1.0
60,en-US,1552.0999424,28.080128,So we need to reconsider that and think in relation to an ecosystem of relationality specic particularly if we talk about the commons So what could be Aniko a kind of methodology and this is the methodology of alliances So going back into the question Um you ask about the political support has been used as a method of directly involving,0.98,1.0
61,en-US,1580.8100352,24.3600384,Uh those that been you know Um relate to the project So for the principles of Gwenview Uh the way it worked was that as I said Uh the Plateau team spend the gaited certain weeks to go in one by one Um to each of them a certain principles of their Um Uh Wendys there,0.92,1.0
62,en-US,1605.3799936,34.8900352,And they created this document called Uh The Principles of Uh Blakeway the Principles of Gwenview And then they decided to go to the wider Um network of collaborators friends and supporters And USCA in this Uh series of Uh Wildcat radio sessions each of their Um chosen Um Um partners to be in these sessions to define in their own words and experience Uh each of those Uh principles,0.98,1.0
63,en-US,1640.4799487999999,24.3301376,So and they created these sessions So for example we have a digital artist and a very long collaborator with blacklegs rrow Uh Pedro Sula Uh expand these Um new media artist with a very long history of new media art in Barcelona and then later in Ecuador and Colombia,0.94,1.0
64,en-US,1665.5300608,26.759987199999998,OK so one last project I've read about is this homemade Annamalai Uh tenor Um You describe it with the term radical imagination as a working method And I see now a little bit how this relates to this thinking together And I quote also from the text if we want to go further we need to think with others,0.97,1.0
65,en-US,1694.5999872,15.8399488,Um Do you want to elaborate a little bit more on this antenna Because if I understood right it's like a metaphorical antenna right It's not a real antenna Yes and no And this to say obviously because I had not at present in Laquidara to see what exactly,0.94,1.0
66,en-US,1710.6599936,35.7500928,They've done Uh it this it's again is is thinking through together and is a project that stand out from Uh Um the collaboration of three members of Um Plateau Federal And Uh it was an interpretation Uh in practice of the principles of Uh Gwenview A radical imagination is another interesting term that the alliance Uh together with and learning and learning is safer paradigm,0.92,1.0
67,en-US,1748.2500095999999,18.7500544,Uh So how can you let things Uh to be open to changes You need not to Uh position yourself in certainty in the knowledge you have but in order to get communally and think through with that there's collectively you need to let us learn,0.93,1.0
68,en-US,1768.1000448,18.4899584,And so this is to shift your paradigm and to do that unique as well A process is a methodology and a vision So basically the radical imagination is the vision how to shift the paradigm how to imagine this paradigm shift,0.94,1.0
69,en-US,1786.8001279999999,30.7798016,So in the case of the anomaly of Tegana Um directly and indirectly speaks about where we living now Uh through the pandemic it's a bio political and social experiment as I say the very beginning of the text Uh The text is very interesting to say that it is written in a Um more like between a manifesto and a poetic Uh form Uh prosaic,0.97,1.0
70,en-US,1817.5799296,29.1299328,but still in a very poetic Um way because obviously Uh poetry allows imagination and creativity within the words So it's a game as well with words but also it's a real experiment in the sense that trying to put together this idea of the equilibrium of that there is a constant and continuous dialog between humans not humans and nature and,0.99,1.0
71,en-US,1846.7098624,19.63008,nature here in the form of funky parasite's Mockbee plays a very important role because funky in this project are in dialog with plastic And if you think that plastic is one of those chemicals that are not easy to Uh dissolve,0.96,1.0
72,en-US,1866.9899776,18.390016,And in nature and basically it is what creates major issues right now on the owner of the impact It has a plastic in our inner world on the environment It's very interesting how in this Uh work the homemade anomaly antenna that works,0.93,1.0
73,en-US,1885.3900288,21.910118399999998,And so this is the Um interesting that and Um one thing that they seem the very beginning is a question we said what do we want to hold them to What are we willing to give up in our world Uh And the other thing that it is interesting is that Um as,0.92,1.0

121,en-US,3035.7100544,22.389964799999998,So activism is very much ingrained in what we do within Uh the center Uh One last question Very last question Um As we know you are a researcher a professional researcher at the same time Um you are in Wolzinger so very much also into activist contexts,0.98,1.0
122,en-US,3058.2200319999997,19.239936,I would like to ask you to talk a little bit about your methodology as how you're doing research and how you see your role as an academic researcher within this context It is not us No it is not as easy and I in the sense that Um OK I'm using,0.97,1.0
123,en-US,3078.6000896,18.599936,Um I would say something between militant anthropology of I'm not a proponent of something geographer but I use ethnography So militant ethnography coming for example from you know for grubbers for example Uh work on militant Uh anthropology That himself has talked about that,0.94,0.99
124,en-US,3097.4099456,21.4102016,So Um using first of all Um my scenography is not let's say static in the sense that it always is in change and in in in in in its making Uh in relationship to our with whom I'm involved and with whom I'm interacting within my ethnographic let's say fieldwork in the case of,0.94,1.0
125,en-US,3119.3100288,22.230016,Um And it is market driven So I would say that the model I am using is closer to something related to Uh collaborative and scenography although this as well has its own issues but something that and closer with Daiki with others I think in with others which is very much what happens in the case of black,0.91,1.0
126,en-US,3142.4700416,17.370112,So in the case of Israel the models have been using is very much on that Obviously I need to Uh say that I mean my research so Summarizer is my voice So it is my interpretation of quite a lot of the things Um I'm discussing,0.96,1.0
127,en-US,3159.8700544,20.1598976,It is very much my presence as who I am And what is my position on this Um Let's say Eco-System that it is with me that my ethnography falls within So who am Um these female let's say academic who is based in Um University UK,0.95,1.0
128,en-US,3180.1499648,16.830054399999998,But at the same time I'm doing research here and there And so there's lots of things to consider So going back into activism for example the work I do here in Athens is more aligned with what you've asked because Um I'm an activist,0.96,1.0
129,en-US,3196.9800192,18.3601152,I belong locked in a number of the no But a couple of activist groups of a certain political set of political alliances And thus Uh my role is very specific there that Um the activists But at the same time I write about this,0.94,1.0
130,en-US,3215.5500543999997,25.58976,So it's about transparency and about making it sound that this is a collective Uh endeavor and a collective effort A number of things Uh I wrote is in alliance again with these people I would say also it is a matter of another term which is use is a refusal at risk to it means that I don't always say everything,0.95,1.0
131,en-US,3241.1398144,28.320153599999998,in Uh the academic texts because of respect Uh of who I'm involved with and the groups and within and it's decision with them what will be delivered outside in either this is the academic world or whatever This always Uh needs to be taken Uh into consideration that this idea of refusal that you cannot speak and say everything in our times,0.91,1.0
132,en-US,3269.7298944,26.730086399999998,OK and I will say this here which I think is interesting because one thing that happens lately and I think it's very important to what you just ask on activism and research and probably in feminist Uh research is that in the last weeks or so we have encountered Uh an attack a direct attack to Uh set and academics in Greece,0.95,1.0

134,en-US,3324.0901632,26.039705599999998,both your rows of positions are very visible and very easy for specific types of Uh Uh fortunately so far only verbal attacks or verbal but social media related attacks But it needs to be taken into consideration And to me it said the US collectively act and this is the idea of and care for each other and to be there,0.94,1.0
135,en-US,3350.3399936,16.5300224,present for each other That like be in the academic Um environment or obviously the activist world And you also formulated Uh a letter of solidarity that you sent around and asked people to sign it Well the euro people can find it,0.91,1.0
