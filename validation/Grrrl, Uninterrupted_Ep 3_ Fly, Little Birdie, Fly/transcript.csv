10,en-US,216.7399936,18.8999936,not the one to be giving advice But this is really more so about me trying to tell my experience so that if you can learn from me you can because I've definitely learned from it But the other day I was looking through my phone and I saw a video of myself just looking out into space and talking,0.98,1.0
11,en-US,235.63998719999998,21.2800256,about how I just wanted to be like the birds And you could hear the birds chirping in the background And it was a little bit melodramatic but I was Probably a good ninety five pounds and you could tell that I was not in the best of of spaces and it was just my senior year in college and,0.97,1.0
12,en-US,256.9200128,20.4599808,I was just going through a I can't even say break up because we weren't even in a relationship It was a very odd situation that I'm going to talk about eventually But it was a tough situation for me to go through on top of me being at the races at school and me dealing with the homophobia and,0.99,1.0
13,en-US,277.3799936,21.4799872,racism and stuff from there So I was at a very low point and it made me become extremely grateful for where I am now It made me think about the difference between who Jalisa was when she was 21 years old 21 22 years old now and and who she is now at 25,0.99,1.0
14,en-US,298.85998079999996,21.4200064,And I think that that Lisa would be extremely proud of this Lisa for going out on a limb in fighting for my happiness And it's kind of weird because Um I used to put on these Porges showcases back in Mississippi in college that were based upon us talking about different topics that affected us,0.97,1.0

17,en-US,355.8599936,17.610009599999998,So it's kind of ironic that I did that video And then now I'm doing his podcast That's going to be entitled Fly a Little Birdie Fly because Um everything just comes full circle Then now I feel very free Extremely free,0.96,1.0
18,en-US,374.12999679999996,14.5199872,And maybe you know eventually I think think of things in my life that I you know in case that I outgrow that I think are Um encaged engaging me but I don't at this moment now I don't feel like that too much,0.99,1.0
19,en-US,389.8800128,16.2899968,Um And I'm very proud of myself for that for fighting for my happiness But Um at that time when that I was that unhappy I knew what was going to make me happy I knew that leaving Mississippi was going to make me happy,0.98,1.0
20,en-US,406.17000959999996,19.8099968,And I didn't think that Regardless of regardless of what I would have done in Mississippi if I would have stayed I would have been in that state I would have been ninety five pounds Um ninety five pounds I would have been depressed,0.97,1.0
21,en-US,428.01999359999996,21.0700032,Um I would have probably went into doing self harm again I'm going to have a topic about that as well But Um a Uh podcast talk about that as well about self harm because I have a past with it But I do know that if I would have stayed there I would have really just seeped into deep depression and there,0.92,1.0
22,en-US,449.0899968,17.750016,was nothing that that state was going to give me to help me I had my friends there I had my family there but I knew that it was it was the environment I had to get away So when my cousin came to me Um my senior year in college and she was like hey I'm moving to Tallahassee,0.99,1.0
23,en-US,466.8499968,17.419980799999998,And I was like OK cool You know Um she was going there for her own personal reasons And I probably slept on it for two days and called up and was like oh look I'm coming too I just do that,0.95,1.0
24,en-US,484.28001279999995,17.12,I wanted to get away like I knew I needed to You know I've always Uh Um wanted to live in Florida That was that has been my dream Um So I knew that I wanted to move to Florida but I didn't move to Tallahassee though because Tallahassee was extremely too much like Mississippi to me,0.98,1.0
25,en-US,501.7900032,20.3899904,So I started to put in different applications and I Um Started traveling basically like I drove down through Orlando for a job interview And then I drove down you know I Uh flew out to Miami for a job interview and I absolutely fell in love with Miami,0.98,1.0
26,en-US,522.2099968,19.5700224,It was the complete opposite of Mississippi with so many black and brown people And in Mississippi it was just extremely too black and white that when I got here I was like it was just like a Uh sigh It was it was a breath of fresh air I had just let out a sigh of relief that I was,0.96,1.0
27,en-US,541.7800192,24.310015999999997,not going to be the only black person or the only like Um Uh The chances of me being discriminated against because I am I have dark skin was very slim I guess that's what I was thinking There's not really the truth all the way because colourism and things are a lot more deeper than what I what I could have,0.96,1.0
28,en-US,566.0900352,16.0799232,seen through the lens of a Mississippian I can see now while living in Miami But this and also another topic for another day But Um I yeah Like I knew that Miami was for me So I went back home and I was talking to my sisters about it like OK this is what I want to do,0.98,1.0
29,en-US,582.1699583999999,13.4400512,I want to move to Miami Um And they were like no girl like you I don't think you need to go Me and my sister filed for probably a good two weeks because I was going to move and she did not want me to leave,0.99,1.0
30,en-US,596.0300543999999,17.9099648,And my stubborn rebellious stuff got into my Ãºltimo and 2006 Altima and had two hundred dollars to my name and drove down to Miami I had a job though but I did not have a place to live did not,0.95,1.0
31,en-US,613.9400191999999,21.900032,And that's where I wanted to start talking about like moving moving It can be liberating You're out on your own I knew absolutely no one here in in the idea was so freeing But the reality is that moving can be really hard,0.96,1.0
32,en-US,636.8300032,17.0999808,And if I can use my experience to help anyone I just want to talk about the things that I learned through my experience that could possibly help somebody else who wants to move to another state I moved almost over 13 hours away from home by myself,0.98,1.0
33,en-US,653.929984,25.640038399999998,So I just wanted to give you a little bit of insight Um about the experience that I went through because it was a lot but I didn't have a place to live I did it in The other thing is that the reason that came down here was the fight for a cause I was trying to do what I,0.99,1.0
34,en-US,679.5700224,17.129984,knew made me happy with I knew made gave me reasons to live which is helping people I wanted to fight for a cause I wanted to make this world a better place So the job that I took here did not it wasn't as secured as I thought that it was going to be,0.97,1.0
35,en-US,698.6800128,24.979968,Um So I just moved here and knowing that I was going to struggle but thinking that it was going to be worth it And Um Uh To not undermine the work of the people who I came down here with Um I'm not going to say but it was extremely hard process to do on your own,0.98,1.0
36,en-US,723.9899647999999,21.8700288,And Um I just think that I would have The if I would have made a plan if I would have thought beforehand how things were going to be then things would have been different So that's what I want to say is that making a plan is important because you can't play around with your own livelihood,0.99,1.0
37,en-US,745.8800127999999,20.5199872,I was homeless like I was living out of my car And jobs aren't very like secured either So like you I was tapping from jobs like it was a lot that was going on And luckily I bumped into some people who allow for me to sleep on their couch and allow for me to you know crash sometimes,0.99,1.0
38,en-US,766.4,15.900006399999999,or whatever But it's not always like that Mississippi You speaking from my experience Mississippi is a very very hospitable place where people are extremely nice And if they see that you are in need then they're going to try to help you,0.95,1.0
39,en-US,782.5399808,20.9399808,But Miami is just not like that Like people are not that nice Like France comingle People have their motives and they they're trying to survive So the The survival mentality is a little bit different from Mississippi like it's the same because I know that I spent a lot of time surviving when I was younger and I really,0.97,1.0
40,en-US,803.4799615999999,20.1900032,live in but it is different So it's just not worth it to put your livelihood at the chance like that And I think that making a plan it would would help out a lot more So making sure you have a place to live at the minimum making sure you have a place to live,0.97,1.0
41,en-US,824.0300543999999,13.469952,Then comes a job And then like Uh if you can't save money if you have money saved up before that's great as well But I do understand the necessity of like wanting to get away and needing to get away,0.99,1.0
42,en-US,837.5699968,22.6999808,Sometimes you don't have that time to prepare So I guess you like I really really do get people who who made the same decision that I did and just move on a hope and a prayer But my Um Um my parents had to be looking out for me like my angels were above me because I could have,0.96,1.0
43,en-US,861.0200576,18.869964799999998,I've gotten put into a lot of crazy situations I've stayed over People stayed over And be really honest I stayed over a guy's house that were really mean to me because I needed a place to stay And I dealt with a lot of stuff that I didn't really have to deal with because I didn't want to go,0.98,1.0
44,en-US,879.8900223999999,14.3099904,sleep in my car at night because it's scary stuff sleeping in your car So sometimes it's you know It's just hard and if you can Just take a moment or take a month and say I'm going to leave in a month,0.96,1.0
45,en-US,894.230016,18.480025599999998,But during this month I am going to save money and every bit of money that I have I'm going to stack it up and then I'm going to move That's better because that way you can get a hotel or you could Uh Um rent a room or Airbnb a place so that you are not sleeping in your car because,0.99,1.0
46,en-US,912.7100416,24.4499456,that's just not the way to go And Uh because the worst thing you could do is move somewhere expecting other people to take care of you or to be nice to you because it's just not Going to happen and Um the other thing is that Um I move to Miami a very emotional person and I was an emotional wreck,0.98,1.0
47,en-US,937.8200575999999,12.9098752,It was so much that I had not dealt with that followed me and it will follow you So if you're trying to move off of the assumption that oh if I just move here everything is going to be OK,0.98,1.0
48,en-US,950.7500031999999,13.169971199999999,That's just not the reality because your problems will follow you if you are your problem And also your issues are going to fall on you if you have not dealt with them So luckily when I came to Miami I,0.98,1.0
49,en-US,965.2299776,23.190016,I think it was like a month of me really partying and getting extremely drunk I think at that time I did have a drinking problem Um I was running from my issues and I was trying to cope with what it felt like to be a little black queer girl from Mississippi who parents who mother died and who dad,0.99,1.0
50,en-US,988.4199936,21.779968,was not around and who had neglect issues and attacked me you know like I was trying to deal with who it meant to be me outside of Mississippi Um And I was running away from that But eventually it took some time for me to Um I met an amazing girl that I'm no longer friends with now but I met,0.98,1.0
51,en-US,1010.1999615999999,19.0800896,an amazing girl who helped me kind of tune into that And I became vegetarian which is what I always wanted to become In high school I wanted to become vegetarian My sister was like girl who buy your food because I'm not about to cook all this stuff and I'm not about to go out you know like she,0.98,1.0
52,en-US,1029.2800512,15.089971199999999,I was not was not in a place to do it at that time So whenever I got on my own and I was buying my own food and I was in my own environment I was able to Um do the things that I knew that would make me feel good,0.98,1.0
53,en-US,1044.3700224,14.279987199999999,So I became vegetarian and I was vegetarian for a year and I started a whole routine I wake up I would meditate I would go for a run I started this whole routine and I things became a lot more clear to me,0.96,1.0
54,en-US,1058.6500096,15.809945599999999,I started to deal with with the effects of my mother's death on my life I started to deal with Um what it meant what me and my father's relationship was and how I felt about leaving my family Um because my little brother is everything to me,0.96,1.0
55,en-US,1074.4599552,14.239948799999999,And so I loved and I did it You know I decided to think about the effects of my life back in Mississippi and what that meant to me and who made me be Um So is going to follow you,0.95,1.0

57,en-US,1104.4499455999999,16.86016,Yes I was going to be a problem when I viewed leaving as the state or city or country that you are trying to leave for better opportunities Go for it Go for it Because I needed to be in a different place for me to be myself for me to even think about what it meant to be Jalisa,0.98,1.0
58,en-US,1121.3101056,14.5998848,and jours and not what it meant for me to be black You know I needed for me to look at myself as a whole And not just as these these identities that were outside of the norm Um in Mississippi,0.95,1.0
59,en-US,1135.9200256,14.2798848,That's extreme to me Like it was overwhelming how different I was So Um yeah like you have to deal with yourself So don't run away from your problems by moving to another state another country that a city like Deal with yourself,0.98,1.0
60,en-US,1150.1999104,27.1801344,You're going to have to deal with that But like I said if you tried to move for opportunities go forward like that That's great Just check this off and make sure that that it is what it is Um You will have to put yourself in uncomfortable situations but never put yourself in unsafe situations,0.93,1.0
61,en-US,1177.8299904,26.1399552,And Coming from a person who did the complete opposite of that like that A necessity I think that you should always think to yourself All right I'm going to be uncomfortable Coming from Mississippi where people drive probably 60 60 miles per hour on the highway and then hear what people are driving like 80,0.96,1.0
62,en-US,1204.1199616,24.959999999999997,That was the different That was uncomfortable coming to Miami where I was Um speaking English a little country girl and majority Everybody here spoke Spanish or Creole like that was uncomfortable What I should have done was put myself in unsafe situations which is which is where the problem comes in of me not having a place to live and,0.97,1.0

64,en-US,1240.8399872,17.7299456,Like you don't put yourself in unsafe situations but it's OK to make yourself uncomfortable Um We all need to get out of our comfort zone sometimes But there is such a huge difference between the two and realizing that is really really really important especially when you're somewhere by yourself,0.95,1.0
65,en-US,1260.3000832,13.6799232,If you have family around you have friends and whatever like that's a little bit easier but by yourself you have to always think like OK I'm not going to be safe Is this is a situation where I'm going to be a little bit uncomfortable or is my livelihood going to be at stake,0.98,1.0
66,en-US,1273.9800063999999,17.1899904,Because those are questions that you have to ask yourself because that's just the truth So Um the next one is not being afraid to ask for help or admit that you were wrong Adjusting and sticking through it so All right,0.99,1.0
67,en-US,1293.270016,17.1599872,How can I explain this one Not being afraid to ask for help I made a mistake My mistake was not taking care of myself My mistake was not looking out for Jalisa first And I had to come to terms with it,0.98,1.0
