6,en-US,119.7500032,16.96,And I mean I feel like It's almost hard for me to know where to begin because I feel like you're doing so many things on levels here in such a short like time we like a little bit over two hundred and fifty pages and I'm like astonished by how how rich this book is but I have to,0.97,1.0
7,en-US,136.7100032,23.2300032,start somewhere So I'm going to start with movie trivia which Um I adore I'd like So there's whenever I'm reading a book that is about You know Creative people and Um and there's reference to movies or books that are that only exist within this world,0.96,1.0
8,en-US,159.9500032,17.6999936,Right Like they have books and movies that have been made up for this story I always get so sad because I know that I will never be able to read that book or watch that film In this case it's Um Vlautin jacarandas of the film that makes me really sad to know that I can never sit down and,0.94,1.0
9,en-US,177.6499968,20.3700096,watch that film because he made it sound so so interesting But sorry I've been off my question which was just that there's so much amazing film trivia in this I learned so much Um about IT film history particularly in Australia,0.96,1.0
10,en-US,198.2,19.08,I had no idea the first feature length film was made in Australia Yeah And screened in Melbourne the Tate Brothers Uh and the Atheneum Theater Yeah We had a very rich and wonderful film History from the jump We had the McDonough's assistants who also have a little cameo in my book,0.98,1.0
11,en-US,217.3400064,20.6999808,I mentioned briefly We had Um you know a ILIAL We had some incredible directors and some incredible writers and actors starting here in the silent film era that really really took off in Australia And then talkies came in And if anyone's a fan of Singin in the Rain I always just think back to the talkies era that's discussed,0.97,1.0
12,en-US,238.03998719999998,24.9300224,in that in that film which I absolutely love that movie so much and the silent film actress that's trying to transition into Uh talking and she talks like this is so beautiful But basically Uh Australia had a very similar issue where we didn't transition into Uh the Tokie era of film the golden ages of of cinema that was all over,0.97,1.0
13,en-US,262.97000959999997,13.049984,in America And then indeed America took hold of our distribution in Australia as well So we really had no ways or mechanisms to raise money and to get films started here So we kind of just faded into existence for a little while there,0.99,1.0
14,en-US,276.41000959999997,13.0799872,Even though Uh the story of Ned Kelly in the Kelly gang was the world's first feature length movie Uh and then we kind of faded away a little bit But in my book indeed Correct I wrote a fictional film history,1.0,1.0
15,en-US,289.910016,21.929983999999997,I kind of reimagined a well I reimagined that Australia actually had a more robust film Uh history Uh And I'm so glad to hear you say that you wish I hope you wish you'd like The Lovings were a real family because they were kind of these kind of inspired by the Barrymore's Uh Drew Barrymore's family tree which includes the silent,0.95,1.0
16,en-US,311.84,16.6199808,film star John Barrymore her great great grandfather I want to say I'm a huge Drew Barrymore fan and I'm just fascinated by her whole family is Um thespians And that's very much the lovegood And I totally feel that if you feel like you wish that this fictional film history was real I feel that when I read the likes,0.98,1.0
17,en-US,328.4599808,19.590016,of Taylor Jenkins read you know the seven the seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo Uh her latest one Melody Rising I totally wish that all of that existed because I want to go off and watch Evelyn Hugo's filmography Uh And I hope that readers of my little OSIWA book equally feel like they wish Blood and Jacaranda was a real film,0.97,1.0
18,en-US,348.41000959999997,21.1799808,that The Loving is we're a real film dynasty that the Uh the feud I imagine with Errol Flynn was real and they control through old newspaper articles And I wish that as well I I very much wish I had because Um I think there's something really magical about making people fall in love with a work of art that only,0.95,1.0
19,en-US,369.5899904,21.0000128,exists in the author's Um mind because it allows you to really talk about the effects that art has Um culturally And I feel like that's that's what's so fascinated me about this book that I consider myself So the book is a love letter to movies,0.98,1.0
20,en-US,390.59000319999996,20.5199872,It's particularly a love letter to the horror genre Mm hmm Um And I like horror film but I realized reading your book that I don't know very much about it and I haven't thought very deeply about it So I don't think I'd ever really thought about looking at the horror genre through a feminist perspective,0.99,1.0
21,en-US,411.68,13.5699968,And you know the book includes your the marvelous Um Oh my gosh And I have to remind me of the name of the film I can only remember the Blair who I quote at the very beginning Linda Blair from The Exorcist,0.94,1.0
22,en-US,425.2699904,18.300031999999998,Is that what you're talking about No the the name of the film club But now I want all Um the final girls Yeah Yes Yeah The girls Yeah It really Um got me thinking about the way women are represented in horror in a way that I hadn't before,0.96,1.0
23,en-US,445.8100224,24.0,Um The walls including all of this is also a beautiful story It's a beautiful remaps you've got a gorgeous laterI tale of first love Yeah you've got a really intense family conflict and you've got a main character who has Um you know really traumatic stuff to deal with in the past,0.97,1.0
24,en-US,470.230016,25.259980799999997,And with all of that going on it's still delightful and funny and cute And like to me being able to have all of those that rich emotional nights being hit and all of that content like just all that thought provoking themes and discussions Um in two hundred and fifty plus pages like how did you do that,0.93,1.0
25,en-US,496.2699776,14.190028799999999,You just said everything that I like writing about I like writing about messy complicated families I like a little bit of love stuff in there But this is this is me kind of going big with the romance This is an LGBT romance Uh Reah and,0.97,1.0
26,en-US,510.85998079999996,12.8600064,Spoiler alert Have a little thing for each other that I think I hope you can say from the very first meeting And from there it's just a hot fluttery It was pure joy for me to write that because I wrote this during lockdown,0.96,1.0
27,en-US,524.0499712,16.8,And Ellie and Ray I totally saved me during my lockdown's last year writing about them I joked and I said it felt like I was writing Uh because my book is set in 2019 I felt a little bit like Noah on the Ark pairing everybody up and saying you're going to be together now because I know what's coming,0.97,1.0
28,en-US,540.8499712,14.090035199999999,in the future and you need to be together and OK and happy But no truly writing Alien Rio was just pure joy for me Uh It's a lot of my heart and feelings on the page with those two And I so will love it if other people love them too,0.96,1.0
29,en-US,555.7499904,23.409971199999998,Um But what that your point I think I always gravitate towards messy family drama And this was just pure joy to research Uh looking for It wasn't hard to find instances of Hollywood family dramas True family dramas Uh Carrie Fisher provided us with a lot of fodder Uh throughout her many memoirs and just life Uh certainly as the Drew Barrymore,0.95,1.0
30,en-US,579.190016,18.419968,Truth be told But then hinging all of this is a bigger discussion than I did indeed want to have about art and how important it is for people to tell their own stories artistically creatively There's a little bit of discussion in there about can you separate the art from the artist and should you Uh which you know I,0.98,1.0
31,en-US,597.6099839999999,15.1799808,don't think will come as a surprise to anybody that I was very inspired by this book in the wake of the MeToo movement and specifically how focused on Hollywood that was And also just the knowledge that we all now have that Hollywood hasn't been the best place for child actors in particular,1.0,1.0
32,en-US,613.2700159999999,14.550016,And there's been no really truly great story of young people surviving Hollywood or any kind of machine industry We're also living in a free Britney era right now where we're all suddenly knowing a little bit more about what she's been through for a decade now,0.97,1.0
33,en-US,628.6599679999999,17.5500288,Uh So all of that went into this And I was having bigger discussions I hope with the reader But you know because I couldn't outright say art is important and we should support art and artists and booksellers and bookstores and independent bookstores,1.0,1.0
34,en-US,646.7199488,13.410048,And you shouldn't fund somebody who just wants to colonize the moon as a fabulous campaign of U.S. indie bookstores that I couldn't come outright and say that that would just be me shouting at the reader for 200 pages,0.96,1.0
35,en-US,660.4899839999999,18.0900352,So I clicked it all in a discussion of the horror genre which I do think is a very misunderstood genre particularly through the feminist lens Most people think of horror and they do sometimes rightly think that it's a genre that has just put Um the decapitation of women on the screen which is accurate,0.98,1.0
36,en-US,678.6099712,20.7300608,Yes Uh but it's also true that horror is statistically speaking the one genre that Uh will often have more female protagonists than male protagonists on the whole and will give women more speaking roles and more speaking time than men This is something that the Gina Davis Institute has investigated,0.99,1.0
37,en-US,699.6400128,22.1400064,Uh Gina Davis the actor from A League of Their Own and Thelma and Louise I found a wonderful institute that delves into women in film represented both on screen and behind Uh And she has you know repeatedly found that horror is is the one genre where women make up more than men in terms of content on the screen speaking,0.97,1.0
38,en-US,721.7800192,18.6299392,lines etc. And it's true as well That's often because women in certain horror films like the slasher genre they have statistically found that women who die on screen in those particular films die for longer So we're seeing them in pain for longer than the male characters which is not great,0.97,1.0
39,en-US,740.9199616,13.1300352,But that's also a kind of Um a throwback to the 80s Slasher films it's not so much prevalent today Today we get I think a lot more nuance in horror and we get a lot more nuanced representations of women in horror,0.99,1.0
40,en-US,755.340032,21.8099712,Um Just thinking about mothers represented in horror films they run the gamut from the truly sinister in Carrie Carrie's mother who locks her in the closet to think about Wendy wielding the ax and the shining and coming to the rescue and you know Uh screaming very well but ultimately saving herself and her son,0.97,1.0
41,en-US,778.6200064,15.7499904,Um Just think about women in horror films Think about Florence Peus character in Midsummer which is a very different kind of horror film now as well Think about how that is ultimately about her grace and then almost play-acting it out in this very surrealist cottage setting,0.96,1.0
42,en-US,795.3900031999999,12.2999808,Um Women run the gambit more often in horror films than anywhere else where they can be sometimes one night depending on their characterization And I kind of wanted to pick that apart And that's also kind of Ali's story as well,0.97,1.0
43,en-US,807.7199872,12.2400256,You know people think that they know what she's about and who she is because of her family and because of this one role that she had in this fairly iconic Australian movie But there's more to it just as there's more to the horror genre for women as well,0.97,1.0
44,en-US,820.8,14.5200128,You just got to dig a little deeper in any kind of art I'm here You did so well I mean listening to you talk on the subject I have been so excited for this podcast Reading the book because I knew that how eloquently you would speak about this new,0.93,1.0
45,en-US,836.310016,23.2999936,Doing everything that I was looking forward to pretty much like Um because Yeah I find it really I find it really fascinating And the fact that I'm out here if you just grab someone off the seat I for to ask them do you think Uh horror movies like are a good representation of female characters,0.9,1.0
46,en-US,859.6200448,18.869964799999998,They would probably initially gut instinct say well no because Horror is sort of I guess more traditionally known as being for the flashes where just a million women get murdered horribly usually like very quickly after you know sex,0.96,1.0
47,en-US,878.8599808,22.5099776,So it's like I just find it such an interesting Discussions like sort of flip that the way that you just did and examine you know how our Examine heart from a feminist perspective and the trope of the final girl like it is the final girl that the girl survives more often than any other character in this,0.92,1.0
48,en-US,901.5199743999999,17.850060799999998,Yeah and that's also partly because they do say that in horror you need someone to root for and someone that you want to live And women are often presented as this ideal of Um the innocent You know there's a lot of sexual innuendo that's up in the final girl that she has to be pure etc. Although some films,0.99,1.0
49,en-US,919.3700352,20.0699904,play with that trope like in Scream the Scream movies with Uh spoiler alert by a few decades surely the 90s maybe you haven't seen it yet Spoiler But the two killers in Scream know all the horror film tropes Uh You know they know that anyone who partakes in sexual activity in a horror film is more likely to die because,0.98,1.0
50,en-US,939.4400256,13.9199488,it's also a little bit of a morality tale as is if you think back to the original horrors fairy tales where horror films of the day horror stories I mean the presence of wolves eating people constantly And they weren't hardly morality tales,0.97,1.0
51,en-US,953.5699968,17.6100352,You know Goldilocks and the Three Bears is literally saying don't go jumping into random beds Young women Um you know Little Red Riding Hood is don't veer off the path Don't talk to strangers Uh These were horror tales and they were morality tales designed by the Brothers Grimm largely to moralize young women in particular,0.99,1.0
52,en-US,971.5399679999999,18.6300416,Uh We've had horror in our lives for a very very long time But it's interesting that horror especially now is coming into the modern age And it's fascinating to see diversity talks in horror films as well something that Jordan Peele has done brilliantly in the film Get Out for instance which is about passive racism,1.0,1.0
53,en-US,991.2800255999999,25.589964799999997,Uh You know the well-intentioned well-meaning but actually quite sinister Um liberal speaking in American Tennes Uh That's all really really fascinating And it's been interesting Jordan Peele in particular has been part of this huge movement of black horror And there's a documentary film about it where they actually say horror works through Um the diversity lens because in America in particular black,0.98,1.0
54,en-US,1016.8699904,16.440115199999997,history is black horror The history of Uh of you know African-Americans in America in particular that's a horror narrative You know the entirety of their history is horror Uh So of course they understand the genre brilliantly and diversely and dynamically,0.99,1.0
55,en-US,1033.6100351999999,16.5700608,And the fact that they're now telling those stories is just fascinating And I fully embrace it I absolutely love it Uh Yeah Lovecraft Um Country County that Jordan Peele was producer of and that he's brought back the Twilight Zone as well,0.98,1.0
56,en-US,1050.1999616,22.2301184,Just fascinating seeing this through a very different lens These old horror narratives just really really fascinating And I think horror does that because horror can be dynamic Horror is the one genre we have as well as maybe romance where we see modern ideals and changes in society through this distorted lens so that we can have bigger discussions,0.99,1.0
57,en-US,1072.4300799999999,20.8799744,about it which is necessary and important And I found this as well while researching Um I found that at various points in time the horror films that were coming out were reflective of social changes So things like carry the film carry and how much blood has significance in that film,0.99,1.0
58,en-US,1093.8500096,18.0299776,And that book from Stephen King that was at a time when the AIDS crisis was hitting the country was hitting the world and blood to continue significance Right So these are little changes And it's stuff like Rosemary's Baby which is possession,0.98,1.0
59,en-US,1112.6299648,23.2500224,Uh And it kind of speaks to the women's liberation movement about women having autonomy over their own bodies If you don't know Rosemary's Baby is about it's it's a doozy Uh that once you know that once you understand Rosemary's Baby through the women's liberation lens you think oh wow this is having big commentary about women's agency over their own,1.0,1.0
60,en-US,1135.8799872,16.2299904,bodies This is fascinating And we still have that today with the likes of Jordan Peele doing us and get out Um and definitely looking at ways he can discuss racism in America through the horror lens which I think is a really natural narrative function for that discussion,0.98,1.0
61,en-US,1152.470016,19.0199808,Brilliantly so And maybe you'll get more people willing to listen to that talk because it's being wrapped up in a genre that they're pretty they think is pretty fun They're happy to have some jump scares from but probably don't realize that they're having a much bigger discussion with the filmmaker than they realize which is what I also,0.98,1.0
62,en-US,1171.4899968,19.0199808,love about at the horror genre that you can sneak in those big discussions wrapped up in this fun I mean I find it fun I like jump scares I like terrifying myself I am somebody who does at least once a year try to watch The Exorcist in the dark when I'm behind the line because I do think,0.97,1.0
63,en-US,1190.5099776,25.069977599999998,that is A total thrill And I and I enjoy it No end I find this discussion this topic and discussions on this topic to be completely just delicious I'm fascinated Um And and what you just said about you know my kids being able to have these wider discussions with their audiences not the audience maybe being aware of it,0.96,1.0
64,en-US,1215.5799551999999,22.5900544,is 100 percent true of the monster All right So it is a gloriously rich book That is Um it manages to tell a really simple satisfying Uh story human story but also effortlessly just like packed into every page Are these bigger discussions,0.96,1.0
65,en-US,1239.640064,15.629926399999999,Um I'm so I'm so excited for kids to be reading this And I did want to ask Uh This is a walkway Um Mm hmm Whereas your previous book which I also love beautifully to you the that changes middle grade readers,0.9,1.0
66,en-US,1255.5400192,16.1099776,What was it like for you changing readership like Oh gosh I think I'm going to be an author who always wants my next project to be the one that I'm not working on So when I was writing the year then that's changed much as I love middle grade,1.0,1.0
67,en-US,1271.6499968,11.7300224,And that was totally the right lens through which to tell that story I was dreaming up the monster of her age and pining for writing Y.A. and I totally just wanted to write a romance as well which I couldn't really do in middle grade,0.99,1.0
68,en-US,1283.3800191999999,12.8699392,It's not really Uh in the sense and sensibilities of that readership So when I was writing the the map change I was dreaming up Alien Reah totally because I was you know the grass is always greener on the other side what I could potentially be writing,0.94,1.0
69,en-US,1296.5500928,12.0598528,So so when I was writing The Monster her age I was also dreaming up a new middle grade novel as well So I'm going to go back to that readership back to my kind of home hometown Uh eventually for the next project,0.96,1.0
70,en-US,1309.1500032,12.539904,But yeah it was a totally different change up But I think I tend to gravitate towards like you say the bigger ideas I'm trying to have with the reader that totally depends on who the rate is going to be,1.0,1.0
71,en-US,1321.7200128,18.9200384,There are some pretty Um profound and scary topics kind of in the monster her age There's a lot in there about emotional abuse that your family not believing you and you've been through something really traumatic And that's definitely lends itself more to teenagers I think because you know reality is,0.97,1.0
72,en-US,1340.649984,14.7600384,Yes Young people of all ages could be going through that But considering how dark or slightly darker it is I wanted to aim at higher up the reading level So I was very conscious of that But you know I did love writing the the map changed,0.98,1.0
73,en-US,1355.4100224,12.150067199999999,I loved writing kids tooling around on bikes in the 90s which when that when I was writing that I thought geez a kid's going to know what riding bikes is such a liberation and how important that was to 90s kids,0.96,1.0
74,en-US,1367.5600895999999,17.509888,And then everything happened in twenty twenty And I saw more kids riding their bikes around my neighborhood than ever before And I thought OK some things have come back OK cool relatable still relatable Also Um that I love both middle grade and Y.A. I'm a big fan of both,0.97,1.0
75,en-US,1385.0799104,17.3000704,And I if I can adeptly swing between the two throughout my career I will Uh Anthony the the monster her age is received I know that the in the maps change has very kindly been embraced by many readers I know that that's being studied in schools,0.95,1.0
76,en-US,1402.3799807999999,9.030041599999999,And my favorite thing is when young people reach out to me and write to me and say oh my gosh I actually enjoyed reading this for school like this prist And they just want me to know that they're shocked,0.96,1.0
77,en-US,1411.650048,14.8299776,I kind of say thank you That's a double win Like it's a lovely thing to hear just on the face of it But when you think about it more the challenges kids face Like it no sure way to kill a book for a kid sometimes,0.96,1.0
