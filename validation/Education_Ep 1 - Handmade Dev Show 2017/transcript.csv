0,en-US,0.61,17.279999999999998,Hello there Uh Welcome to the first Handmaid Dev Show podcast Um You might be a little you know hesitant to accept that I'm just doing a podcast I've had a lot of people say you know you just keep doing twitch streams and you know never do offline recordings,0.95,1.0
1,en-US,18.099999999999998,12.54,But I do feel like there's enough people in the community doing streams all the time So maybe me going the podcast where we're hoping it'll also help with guests who can be more flexible with their schedule if I do adjust podcasts,0.97,1.0
2,en-US,31.029999999999998,20.09,So if you are not from here may not work and you're some person from the Internet who just happened to stumble upon this beautiful podcast My name is Abner Coimbra Um I will be your host And Um I happen to be currently my status is Uh a civil servant of the United States,0.94,1.0
3,en-US,51.129999999999995,19.6200032,I work for Kennedy Space Center at NASA Um I just made it two or three years working there which is pretty cool And I also lead the Community Handmaid Network and we will talk about what I mean like work is especially today because I have somebody who is a founder of you know Handmaid Dev Hemin that we two,0.91,1.0
4,en-US,70.7500032,12.8299968,And that would be Andrew Can you hear me Andrew Yes Hello Greetings Um So we will talk about what that is But I am assuming most people know what it is So I'm just going to go with that line of thinking,0.95,1.0
5,en-US,83.6,16.6699968,Everybody knows who we are So first of all Andrew congratulations Well there's there might be Uh who we think we are and then there's who everybody else thinks we are Uh Those might not be the same thing So maybe we should make sure everyone's on the same page you know,0.98,1.0
6,en-US,101.5899968,20.4000064,OK so Um do you want to start like saying who you are I guess Oh yeah sure Um So I am Uh a student Uh up in the Seattle area Um I go to the University of Washington Um I've been part of the Handmaid Network and my Dove team for a couple of years now,0.96,1.0
7,en-US,123.22000639999999,18.9900032,Um I do Uh most of the front end development on the on the site Um And Uh Uh in addition to that I also do a lot of Uh Hobbie programing Um I wrote the bot that sits in the handmaid hero Chad Um I wrote a library for you know using the Twitter API through,0.92,1.0
8,en-US,142.2100096,18.5399936,See Uh I just sort of random stuff Um So that's that's me Um When you said that you do programing stuff as a hobby I think that's an understatement Um You seem to live breathe eat programing all the time It's it's insane,0.96,1.0
9,en-US,161.8600064,22.609996799999998,Uh Yeah Uh it's far far too many hours out of my day Yeah Have you considered you know Um skydiving or dancing Well skydiving might be better for my Uh long term Um mental health I don't know Uh Less less sustained stress Just you know one time events,0.97,1.0
10,en-US,185.6300032,18.259993599999998,Okay well that's good And the University of Washington people should know it's a great university when it comes to computer science so Oh and computer engineering Which is what you're doing Yeah Well yeah So I mean we have the the the whole like School of CSC which is just computer science and engineering,0.96,1.0
11,en-US,204.03998719999998,24.2000128,Basically you decide whether you want to do like the more theoretical track or the more like hands on down to the hardware track which is computer engineering So that's that's what I'm doing Yeah So that's fascinating Um So hum when it comes to me Um like I said earlier Uh I've been working for Kennedy Space Center for about three years,0.99,1.0
12,en-US,229.5399936,21.84,Um And Uh Uh I am I like what Dimitri Spannaus said on the community shot one day I am the ideologist in chief of Handmaid Dev So basically I established the policies and the guidelines of how to get the network to grow how to get the people there excited about software projects and challenges and how to move forward with the,0.96,1.0
13,en-US,251.37999359999998,15.0899968,community So I'm basically also leading the team whenever I can sort of oversee development not so in-depth because I trust everybody there They do a fantastic job So but I try to keep an eye on things make sure we get the website patches up or features done in time,0.99,1.0
14,en-US,267.7300224,17.5499776,Um I also have a patron on I have to deal with taxes all the financial stuff Yeah That to me that's that's your most important job making sure the money goes to the right place Exactly And making sure you guys get compensated making sure I get more money for you guys or more money for the servers and email,0.96,1.0
15,en-US,285.28,20.7000064,servers and Uh paying for the addresses for email Uh et cetera Or maybe one day be able to hire moderators you know for Yeah Yeah More stuff to help out with the stuff for you Yeah And I'm very open about that and everybody from the team has access to the patrons so I'm just trying to get people excited about,0.96,1.0
16,en-US,306.4,12.879999999999999,how that work and sort of supporting it whether financially or just by being active and by contributing to Uh a lot of things that I'm not even talking about today actually So you know we'll leave it at that So it's,0.92,1.0
17,en-US,319.6600064,13.9099904,Yeah yeah yes Good stuff So I hope that's a good intro A good introduction And Uh assuming now that we know what happened that is you know what You remember that we just told them who we are We haven't told them what happened,0.94,1.0
18,en-US,333.5799808,16.4999936,I guess you're right man I wanted to Oh my God You know before we can talk about the future let's talk about the present How have we even agreed on what Handmaid Network is Uh Hi Uh Uh Well I think it's a Web site,0.91,1.0
19,en-US,351.45999359999996,14.0100096,Uh Are we on the same page It's a website right Yeah That's a good first stepping stone OK cool Uh Glad we can agree on that Um Uh I think we would both say it's a Uh it's a programing website Yes Um for sure,0.95,1.0
20,en-US,367.0000128,29.820006399999997,Uh It's a website about programing Uh specifically about about programing Um Well in some definition of the word Well Oh yeah We'll get into that later I suppose Um Yeah Uh But at the moment Um we are trying to you know Uh allow people to Um post about Uh what kind of programing they're doing Um outside of their jobs or Uh inside of their jobs as the case,0.99,1.0
21,en-US,396.8200192,19.4699776,may be Um and Uh you know Uh Uh give them access to the community Um that's been building up around this this ideology Um and try to you know keep the momentum going Um But I guess that brings us to Uh you know where we're going in the future,0.99,1.0
22,en-US,416.950016,17.6499712,Yeah So something I want to say is you said Premiere network is about a place where I guess we have people doing programing projects right and we would give them a platform to showcase their software projects But they're doing software in a way that we think is like you said well like they're doing it well or they're,0.97,1.0
23,en-US,434.67002879999995,20.0699392,doing that Yeah High quality along somewhere between the quality who's listening thinks if they're programmers think that what they're doing they're doing it well Right So Um that's why we call this the handmade way All right So we do want to go into what we mean when we say programing well,0.93,1.0
24,en-US,454.739968,20.160051199999998,And and there's going to be a lot of discussion because in the future we're going to be creating kind of you know lessons and courses and Uh Yeah well let's let's talk about that So Uh Uh future directions you know Um we just Uh closed down on V one Um version 1.0,0.98,1.0
25,en-US,474.9100032,13.010022399999999,It's done Yeah Uh We didn't get everything in there that we would plan But you know that's that's always how things go Yeah One of the big downstep gave a big shout out Yeah You and I are part of that team working on the community working on the website,0.94,1.0
26,en-US,487.9200256,13.009971199999999,But you know you have Uh your own kmn So big shout out to him He is the back end developer He makes the whole security measures and all the requests going in and out on the server everything right Um Yeah,0.97,1.0
27,en-US,500.99998719999996,14.9699584,And the Web framework And you hop out there but you do more of the design Yeah well Uh he he definitely took the lead on that Um I've just been Uh hacking my way through his code base basically Yeah he's And we know he's amazing,0.96,1.0
28,en-US,515.9699456,18.390016,He he's very knowledgeable about Web development whether or not he likes it It's a different story but he does do it well Um And we also have Right Matt Mascarenhas who is Mabou and he has more and more become a community moderator like a global one you know just sort of overseeing everybody making sure they're filling,0.95,1.0
29,en-US,534.8100096,15.530035199999999,Yeah he's Uh he's he's always there and all the shots Uh Well mostly irisa Uh and discord these days Here he is on principle I mean like he's there like you can see his name Um You it sometimes goes on line there,0.91,1.0
30,en-US,551.5399679999999,23.640012799999997,Um Yeah but he's around Um He I mean as anyone in the community probably knows he's been Uh leading the annotations on on Handmaid Hero for more than a year now Yeah Yeah Pardon the buzzer Um Uh And Uh Uh he's also done annotations for numerous other Uh streamers in the community Um all around,0.98,1.0
31,en-US,575.1799808,18.450022399999998,Just really hardworking guy Uh It's really awesome to have him on the team Absolutely Um Now OK let's go back to what we're trying to do for the future So Um it's interesting because you know the programing of the handmade way usually means that you're caring about what you're doing,0.98,1.0
32,en-US,593.6300031999999,20.5100032,You're taking the time to understand it You're taking the time to create software that is not wasting the user's time blah blah blah Right So Right well well I mean specifically we are like fighting against you know you're just saying Uh this is the one way I learned how to do it,0.97,1.0
33,en-US,614.1500416,17.0199552,So I'm just always going to do it this way You know we want people to be able to explore different ways of doing things Um different new Uh innovative algorithms and and ways of structure and code and and all that kind of thing,0.98,1.0
34,en-US,631.5500032,17.100032,So Um that usually go ahead That usually means shying away from I want to say golden rules Uh shying away from I guess you could say dogma or Um certain ideologies that sort of force you to be rigid in the way you program things,0.98,1.0
35,en-US,649.0399744,12.270028799999999,Right Right Right We kind of want to break free from that and say OK what what happens in actual reality when I'm programing this when I'm writing this code what's happening to the computer What's the Uh implications of speed,0.99,1.0
36,en-US,661.3100032,11.2200192,What's the implications of user experience You want to evaluate all of that as much as you can right You can't always do it thoroughly but you care enough to sort of go beyond copy pasting something from the Internet,0.99,1.0
37,en-US,672.6500351999999,12.3299328,Right Um Right It's almost like software Uh Uh Uh It's not a job That's why I don't I never promote this as like you're doing this as part of your job You're doing it because it's something you care for as a craft,0.98,1.0
38,en-US,685.6999936,15.690035199999999,Right Right Exactly Yeah It's a labor of love Uh A labor of love Yeah And because the the world right now is so I don't want to say infested but it's it's ubiquitous with software Right Everything's being managed by,0.97,1.0
39,en-US,703.219968,15.2400384,Um Well if you want good Should I say infested might be a good word actually You know the toaster has my toaster is running Linux Ah no not my fridge to add spreading Yeah Because you know it's a cash cow right now,0.91,1.0
40,en-US,718.4600064,15.299993599999999,And everybody wants to go into computer science Everybody wants to go camping engineering because that's the one thing where you're going to be paid Well because there are places right Yeah Places where people in power know that computing and many of the things that brachiosaurus computer science is the future,0.97,1.0
41,en-US,733.76,13.9500032,So they're paying them well So every single type of person is going to go into software Those who care about it Those who don't Those who just want to make money Right And so we in the past it was so hard to do software that you have to have good people who care about it,0.99,1.0
42,en-US,747.8900224,11.059968,But now that's not the case anymore So we're sort of losing those people who care We're not we're not losing that well Well so so Uh I would I would I would interpret it slightly differently than that actually Sure,0.96,1.0
43,en-US,759.1999999999999,21.149952,Um OK I mean I don't want to say that people these who go into software these days don't care I think they care a lot actually Um The problem is that Uh Well yeah Um the money is all in Uh building on top of Um all these abstractions that have been built up over the last 30 40 years,0.98,1.0
44,en-US,781.1899903999999,20.489984,Um And so you have all these jobs in like Java enterprise things and Web development Um And so that the sort of skills you have to learn from that is like how to use Um a a system that already exists that has sort of arbitrary Uh Uh unlike,0.96,1.0
45,en-US,803.3800192,21.9899904,Sort of random Yeah yeah Rules that you have to learn that just are there and there's not like an underlying like consistency to it Um There's no underlying logic Um If you're coming out from there and I know because I came at it from there Um and Uh and what we're trying to to do here is is go you know,0.97,1.0
46,en-US,825.3700096,18.660044799999998,Well OK so Um I mean there actually is an underlying system of logic and you can learn it And it's it's not actually all that complicated Um And once Yeah And once you once you know how to deal with it you can do you can do crazy stuff like you don't you can't just you can do more than just,0.99,1.0
47,en-US,844.0300543999999,15.9199232,make a website Yeah Yeah That you get a level of control that you would not have seen if you would have just stuck at the surface level of what they're What they're usually teaching you in some places right where it's more like it's more geared towards OK this is where the money is,0.97,1.0
48,en-US,860.2800128,14.3099904,Therefore we're going to teach you the things that people use right now in terms of like tools that you're going to use versus this is how the computers work behind the scenes This is how it's architected This is how the CPU accesses ram through the control logic and be able to do all of that,0.97,1.0
49,en-US,874.6800128,19.6199424,Right So yeah so I think this is a perfect segue way actually to what were Uh intending to to say here which is that Uh going forward Uh with Henry Network we want to make it possible to Um to come to the site and just and learn all this stuff in a really easy and straightforward way,0.94,1.0
50,en-US,894.4199679999999,27.990015999999997,Because to us you know it's it's like it's the simplest thing in the world Right But if you're coming into it you know Uh you have these like Uh these these guides that were written in the 1970s that Uh are like completely in like incomprehensible or you have like coming at it from weird angles using like huge tool chains that,0.98,1.0
51,en-US,922.409984,15.510015999999998,require like intricate knowledge of how JCC works Um And so what we want to do is sort of boil it down to the simplest pieces and then present those in a really easy to understand way Um Sort of cut out the crap there,0.99,1.0
52,en-US,938.2800384,13.0499584,Um So that's that's sort of the the general gist of where we want to go with Uh the educational stuff What we're doing I guess we want to answer first why why Hamming Network wants to go the educational route in the first place,0.97,1.0
53,en-US,951.4500095999999,13.890048,Why can't we just have really amazing software that is you know like I said these are some characteristics that could come out of the handmade way software that's you know fast you know efficient It's done It's developed in a way that doesn't make the developer cry inside,0.95,1.0
54,en-US,965.4600704,19.2299008,It's all right It's Uh it's valuable It's caring software You can tell the person care a lot about it It's individualized So those are some of the values right now You know they need all we have to thread And this is sort of what we've been battling for over two years Andrew is we have to acknowledge there is,0.95,1.0
55,en-US,984.6899712,21.510041599999997,very little incentive to do things to have made way I would Right I would say none at all Right Um Because there is immense pressure with project deadlines Uh the baggage of like historical Covid basis that you have to do within your company Uh the work culture in a way that makes the same with your everyday life because you worry,0.95,1.0
56,en-US,1006.2000128,15.5899904,about paying taxes doing school Um So really how can you galvanize people into hamade programing when everything around you suggests very convincingly I might add that there simply isn't any value to doing things that way you just explained Right right,0.98,1.0
57,en-US,1021.7900032,20.04992,Right And I mean Uh that's that's sort of the central problem that we've been physically So our answer to this has been recently well it's education for beginners and for the younger folks usually Um like create a wealth of very interesting products that uses like not only see not only C++ not only assembly but also modern tools,0.95,1.0
58,en-US,1041.8399232,14.0100608,You could have seach opportunity It's OK Um But these lessons I guess would come from a mindset of someone who is not fighting golden programing rules all the time and who is not hand waving the quote unquote difficult algorithms,0.96,1.0
59,en-US,1056.1200128,14.8799488,Right So it's interesting because I'm not sure how to develop lessons like that Um Right Like how could but it would be interesting to like imagine Um my thoughts a little shaky on this And I'm going to give you like an example of what a lesson would look like,0.96,1.0
60,en-US,1071.8399488,13.7101312,And then you can sort of give me feedback So Um let's say we were to provide a course on I don't know how to create like an army of evolved Martian cockroaches that will try to steal your chocolate wine in different ways,0.98,1.0
61,en-US,1085.8500096,16.1099776,Right Um Uh For those who don't know it's like relevant programing work Right It's a game Right You have Martian cockroaches They're going to try and steal your wine So Um I let's say this course is using C SARP in unity,0.95,1.0
62,en-US,1102.2600192,16.5000192,Right So let's say this C shopping unity course is part of handmade So I would want to help the reader go into that course with the knowledge of a few very basic things like for example that theCIA was designed to reflect the common language infrastructure,0.97,1.0
63,en-US,1119.4499071999999,18.180096,Right Um That's used by Microsoft dot net framework Right Like I want them to know that the seashell compiler will usually target a common language runtime Right But I want them to Uh but want to know why the designers prefer it to compile to a common language runtime,0.97,1.0
64,en-US,1138.1400575999999,12.5299712,But you could theoretically have a cetra compiler generate machine code like any other traditional compiler Yeah well I mean and it's especially relevant in the context of unity because unity doesn't use Microsoft's dot net framework They use Uh MONAR,0.95,1.0
65,en-US,1150.7399679999999,15.690035199999999,Well actually I think they use their own implementation these days Uh Exactly so somebody knows that OK see Chopper was designed to reflect the common language infrastructure who implements the common language infrastructure Well you have the common intermediate language was dot net framework would use but any Uh any other framework could use it,0.93,1.0
66,en-US,1166.5200128,13.199974399999999,And you need to use this a different one So that kind of knowledge which people will consider superfluous or necessary actually informs you of how to understand unity and how to understand your creation of that tool or of that game,0.96,1.0
67,en-US,1179.7799936,17.460019199999998,Right right right And I think you know you can intersperse things like that throughout and try to build a more Uh foundational understanding of what's going on than just Um oh you create the model behavior class and that's how you program your script into the game,0.97,1.0
68,en-US,1197.5999488,9.030041599999999,You know like like why is that there What is that doing What is the engine doing for you there That kind of thing Or even or even knowledge of like OK I want the reader to know that you can use,0.99,1.0
69,en-US,1207.2600576,15.299993599999999,You can use memory address pointers and see SARP Right now the compiler expects you to use the unsafe keyword and that it won't allow you to fully manage memory like you have a garbage collector Like Um I would want them to know though that it could have easily been done the other direction,0.95,1.0
70,en-US,1222.680064,19.8898688,You could have had explicit control The designer of switch up could have done it So you can actually control memory and carry it as you please Right Because this is how Yeah And Uh it's funny because the Microsoft to do that with their managed C++ Um there's a different kind of pointer if you want it to be managed by,0.93,1.0
71,en-US,1242.5699327999998,14.970060799999999,the garbage collector Yeah My my I guess my core point here is if they can go down the rabbit hole of abstractions and come back on the top without batting an eye The way I would write the lesson for creating a Martian cockroach army would be voidable,0.98,1.0
72,en-US,1257.5399936,16.5900288,A lot of dogma would be the void of a lot of Uh golden rules and principles because I know that person understands what's going on Um in reality and that mostly everything is designed by a human right Everything you do in the compiler Uh your text editor all of that is just human made,0.97,1.0
73,en-US,1274.1300224,13.770035199999999,And it could go a different direction if you wanted it to Right Right And it's Uh largely based on you know the last 40 or 50 years like what just sort of caught on Uh some of which is is very arbitrary,0.98,1.0
74,en-US,1288.2299904,14.459904,A lot of it is very arbitrary even even the design And there's this this scares some people I don't know why even the design of like architectures Right We're using the von Neumann architecture sometimes Right where you have the same database Um for instructions and for data,0.95,1.0
75,en-US,1302.6898944,12.360192,But they don't have to go that way either You could have had a different way for the computer to have been architected Right So Well I mean Uh Uh to the programmer it's exposed that way inside the CPU as it goes on,0.96,1.0
76,en-US,1315.8299648,10.200064,Yeah but obviously you don't we're not advocating for you to know how to design your own computer even though that's part of that's of course I want to have fun But you don't have to It's almost it's just that you're aware of it,0.98,1.0
77,en-US,1326.1800448,11.9199744,Right And you understand that you don't have to be scared that you don't have to follow these things as if it was science This was just human made decisions to sort of deal with computers in a way that helped that person's psychology or help that person's need,0.98,1.0
78,en-US,1338.2199296,11.990015999999999,Yeah Right Exactly So I course this would be very different from any other one on the Internet I would say if if we have for sure everyone knows this but how do we have beginners and young people like know this,0.91,1.0
79,en-US,1350.4200704,23.8198784,Yeah And that's honestly what Yeah And I think that's that's an awesome goal to be working towards But Uh obviously you know developing Uh full courses is is quite a bit of effort And Uh anyone doing that would would largely be doing it Um without much or any compensation that would be better,0.98,1.0
80,en-US,1374.4799744,24.2400256,So yeah so in sort of the short term Um I think what we want to do is is sort of try to get some like topical articles shorter form tutorials like Um basically things that can fit into a blog post Um that we can start you know sort of Uh collecting separately and displaying prominently on the site,0.99,1.0
81,en-US,1399.9799295999999,17.290137599999998,Um Mm hmm And then from there start looking at Um like a longer form tutorial series Um interactive stuff that kind of thing You know something I was talking with I was talking to Alan Webster a few days ago Um We we talk a lot on the hangout sometimes discussing stuff like,0.96,1.0
82,en-US,1417.4999552,18.99008,And Um we agreed that we want these courses and how that work to be complete And so to put it another way we want these courses to not be hand waving And we write this a lot of tutorials that just say here's how you do X follow this algorithm,0.95,1.0
83,en-US,1437.2400128,11.31008,Um Yeah exactly You know and it's almost like why they didn't just sort of explain how the algorithm came to be Not even maybe some history maybe some maybe let them try it out a little bit themselves Um You know it's hard to design courses,0.97,1.0
84,en-US,1448.5500928,14.379929599999999,I get it right hard And sometimes you want a hanway because you just don't know how to present it But Something we agreed on though is that we want to be able to not hand wave And I do think you have the right people in the community to sort of you know like I like Alan Dmitri's panel,0.95,1.0
85,en-US,1464.5199871999998,15.270092799999999,Um And so far as you know these are people who Marten's Mosaic's these are people who have programed for so long Um And they always explore new things So they sort of know what they have to go through to uncover new ways of doing things,0.93,1.0
86,en-US,1480.0900096,14.700032,So it's not impossible It's it's just Yeah Yeah Uh But the point is that we're interested in making this happen And actually I want to say if somebody is interested in listening to this podcast if you're an educator if you're a teacher please email me somehow,0.97,1.0
87,en-US,1495.0300671999998,17.2198912,I don't know Abdnor at Handmaid Dove dot org Please Yeah And Uh even if you're not Uh employed as an as an educator if you have any interest in you know passing on some of your knowledge or experience Um you know a lot about a certain topic,0.98,1.0
88,en-US,1512.4300799999999,17.2199936,Contact us Um You know think about if you'd you'd be willing to write some kind of series of blog posts or Um Um or even a video series Um explaining some kind of topic in depth We'd love that Yeah And we already have a few people who are willing to volunteer their time,0.99,1.0
89,en-US,1530.8199935999999,16.1399808,Um So and I'm meeting with them Uh this weekend So that'll be fun And maybe next podcast I'll explain what's been going on But yeah Um So that's basically how I mean that we finished the website version 1.0 We are trying to make educational materials,0.97,1.0
90,en-US,1547.9799808,18.660044799999998,Um Was there anything else you wanna talk about specifically about the network Uh Well Uh I just wanted to mention sort of Um things which didn't make it into one point out that we still want to look at Um you know aside from Uh our educational outreach efforts Um Uh just to sort of Uh give you a laundry list,0.97,1.0
91,en-US,1567.4200064,15.000064,Uh We have some conception of our project lifecycle that didn't really make it in Um You know we understand that some projects Uh you know are entering eventually enter a sort of finished state where you don't really need to update it regularly anymore,0.97,1.0
92,en-US,1583.0500352,18.1799936,Um And we want to be able to support that as well as Uh projects that go on hiatus Um without you know Uh penalizing people too much for that Um We want to have better integration with GitHub GitHub Um because those are fairly critical parts of a lot of software projects,0.98,1.0
93,en-US,1601.6800767999998,22.349926399999998,Um And Uh if you've got a GitHub page for your project we wanted to not be a burden to also update your Henmi no work page Um Uh We want to get a system integrated very tightly with the site Um Right now we have an Irish sea and a discord Um which are sort of covering like your two basic groups of people in,0.97,1.0
94,en-US,1624.0300032,30.2700544,terms of like chatting Uh systems But Uh we are we're trying to find Uh something that will work Um for both types of Uh users and that we can put Uh in tightly with the site Um I've had this idea for a while of of having Um Uh sort of channels next to the forums Um that you can just access on the website Um that are cleanly integrated,0.97,1.0
95,en-US,1654.3000576,13.1398656,in there And so like Uh when you create a project you don't only get a forum in a blog you also get like your chat channel Um That's been something I've been wanting to do for a while but Uh none of the systems we looked at would support very well,0.99,1.0
96,en-US,1667.4599936,23.200051199999997,We'd probably have to look at doing something in-house for that So that would be that would be quite a bit in the future Um Uh more realistic short term things Uh We want to be able to support multiple mirrors Um for downloads on projects Um make it so that it's easier to see Uh like how many downloads your files have Um Uh you know cycle,0.98,1.0
97,en-US,1690.6600448,21.2099072,through releases that kind of thing Um And also eventually we want to be able to give you the option to Uh have people pay for your software Um We appreciate open source software but we're not exclusively a free software community Um So we want to we want to support people who who want to sell their software Um and if they can do,0.99,1.0
98,en-US,1711.869952,15.4200064,it through the network That would be awesome Yeah Yeah sure All right This is a very long list Um Yeah it's a lot it's a lot to do You can see why I didn't make it into 1.0 Yeah Um And that's very interesting,0.94,1.0
99,en-US,1727.2899584,12.1700352,Hopefully you know version 2.0 etc. Well we just keep growing And Um I know a lot of people more active on the network because you know the website release and people are excited So you know it'll it'll keep going,0.94,1.0
100,en-US,1739.4700288,20.4998656,It's awesome Um All right So I want to get into some icy topics So yeah now it's interesting because first of all congratulations because I know you just turned Uh 20 Happy birthday Thank you Um That was yesterday so you're no longer a teenager,0.97,1.0
101,en-US,1760.7901184,21.4499328,Mm hmm It's pretty awesome Now I guess what's not awesome is um for example and I want to try and keep this under the programing topics but Um it'll be hard because you know we'll talk on the chat when I talk on the New York streams that people Uh do you know programing streams,0.92,1.0
102,en-US,1782.2599168,18.56,Jonathan Blow v.c et cetera It's a lot of talk of of the climate that we're living in right now Right Yeah The the goddamn political climate And you know Yeah I usually try to stay away from that And my question actually I haven't asked you this question,0.94,1.0
103,en-US,1800.8299519999998,21.3600256,My question to you is hmm Would have meant network have a role in sort of doing things outside of its purview of you know software development Um Because we still have real people real humans talking in the community discussing politics feeling Uh concerned about the current state of things in twenty seventeen,0.97,1.0
104,en-US,1822.3398912,13.87008,Some people are celebrating it Right We have we have a healthy mix but it's it's unlike anything in the past because it's so I'm not sure it's it's always a bit of hysteria I guess is what I want to say,0.99,1.0
105,en-US,1836.6601216,37.369856,So yeah Uh Um it's it's definitely not a situation that we've seen in recent history Um I think probably both sides can agree on that Um Yup yup yup Uh Let me said Um in terms of of of Henry Network or the Henry Dove Uh Foundation you know doing political outreach Um you know when you say that it's it's not you know Um but well you,0.96,1.0
106,en-US,1874.0299776,26.0900864,know like you have Um you know Uh recently Um a bunch of of game developers all Uh Uh have ran sales where all their proceeds were donated to the ACLU Um That that was Uh an interesting use of Uh their position I think Um I I don't,0.95,1.0
107,en-US,1901.060096,25.349939199999998,Think it's political or Uh a controversial statement to say that Uh civil liberties are important Um Hmm But the fact that you might interpret those sales as being political in nature Uh sort of says something about where we are Uh in the United States anyway,0.98,1.0
108,en-US,1927.640064,15.399935999999999,And it's interesting you say that because you and I are both we're both pretty young That's why I was mentioning the whole you you know as being in our 20s Um is we have people from the community who are older who are in their 40s or 50s and they're amazing,0.96,1.0
109,en-US,1943.0600703999999,23.939891199999998,Right But when it comes to political discourse or whether we should have it or not Um it's OK People say this is what happened in these days People hear the loudest voices Right which tend to be outrage And of course you know does that gives off a cartoonish version of our political views Um whether it's whether it's a political,0.94,1.0
110,en-US,1966.9999616,16.020070399999998,view of an individual or a collective You know because there are so many loud voices That's never been a problem obviously But the reality is that it's all amplified through the Web Right You know you only hear the worst version of anybody's position,0.98,1.0
111,en-US,1983.3499648,11.9001088,And this amplify because that's the one that people share Yeah I mean something that you get bombarded with every day now It's that's not like the past where you could easily turn off the television right now Your phone would probably send off an alert,0.95,1.0
112,en-US,1995.2601088,14.3097856,That's political in nature Um Right Well yeah your your Uh your your website where you chat with your friends is the same Web site where you read all your news is the same website where you get harassed by thousands of enemy avatars,0.95,1.0
113,en-US,2009.730048,17.7199104,Yeah Um As a consequence Andrew is that like the arguments of either side You know they're dressed in a dumpster fire of online hysteria is what I'm trying to say And that's taken away Now once it's taken that way the willingness to take the other's issues the other people's issues like seriously,0.94,1.0
114,en-US,2028.4100607999999,27.0598144,Um Yeah I mean it's sort of Um you have almost a reflexive like Uh shut down when you hear when you hear someone start arguing with you like Um you just sort of expect to be like shouted at Um So even if people are trying to have you know reasonable arguments you can only hear like the worst version of that because there's,0.99,1.0
115,en-US,2055.4698752,19.500031999999997,just been so much of it Yeah that's true And you know another thing is I just can't believe that with how many streams of information we have at our fingertips we still choose to filter the things we don't want to see even though I thought you know when the Internet came something more mainstream Uh it would be some,0.99,1.0
116,en-US,2074.9699072,16.620134399999998,place where you could see everything you know all points of view all things that you couldn't see before because of people getting that access to that information Now you can actually look anywhere but you don't And Right It's it's it's too much information in some ways,0.98,1.0
117,en-US,2091.5900416,14.970060799999999,And because of that you sort of self filter out You know what you don't like I don't wanna say what you don't want to hear but like what you don't feel like you have the energy or the time or the attention duration to hear,0.94,1.0
118,en-US,2106.5900032,20.2201088,Yeah Um Yeah So that's sort of what people talk about in terms of like echo chambers is is interesting to me because like it's sort of the natural like human tendency is to form like circles Um of of like people with similar views,0.99,1.0
119,en-US,2128.1898496,19.8602752,Um But it it works so much faster and so much more intensely on the Internet It's weird Yeah Yeah What I think is OK now that you cleared up a lot of thoughts in my head so I would say Hemin Network would be some place where if there is something we could do related to let's say I don't,0.97,1.0
120,en-US,2148.0501248,20.8797696,know you know there's some charity happening across the gaming community because there is some person who is Uh underrepresented or there there's some person who is suffering And we can raise a charity to sort of help that person you know go into some college or something like that there write some some some issue that's politics politicized in grandiose,0.94,1.0
121,en-US,2168.9298943999997,26.500096,way across the community And we want to help them Right So Uh I think hamine that we could be involved in something like that or Um Well yeah Yeah What do you Um I I don't know I I'm I might be hesitant to Um sort of give Uh Uh be the like root of something like that but to endorse it maybe would be,0.95,1.0
122,en-US,2195.8399999999997,18.2099968,I don't want to say actively get engaged in political matters Um I think I mean obviously Just stay Um 90 percent of the time 95 percent of the time with our missions that we were discussing at the beginning Right Which is you know software development and doing things to handmade way and you know caring about your software treating it,0.93,1.0
123,en-US,2214.1700096,12.8100352,like a craft education blah blah blah Right Um Well that's interesting And we should always strive to just focus on that But if there's something that directly affects the community and that's what I was trying to say at the beginning right,0.98,1.0
124,en-US,2227.1598592,13.920256,There are people who are directly affected or they or they just want to discuss it all the time We could say well we endorse this and we don't endorse that because at the end of the day I mean that work is made up of a team of people human beings who may or may not want to go,0.98,1.0
125,en-US,2241.1700224,14.5799168,some direction And maybe the politics of how things are working right now effect It has meant that work in itself Right So when that happens then yeah we do want to say yes Hey you know you know this is what the team of Hemin that we're thinks and this is what we endorse,0.92,1.0
126,en-US,2255.7499392,11.52,This is what we don't endorse Um Now the team rather you know there's not a majority vote of like we don't want to get involved Fine But the idea that we're never going to even consider it that's what I don't want to say,0.99,1.0
127,en-US,2267.4499584,11.400191999999999,I want to say right when we we might want to consider you know saying some things like you said standing up for civil liberties Uh or things like that and that might cause some strife that might cause some controversy,0.93,1.0
128,en-US,2278.8501504,24.569855999999998,But you know Yeah well I think there's Um some you know you're talking about things that directly affects us Uh as a community Um Things like you know net neutrality Uh Exactly Uh I Uh like the kinds of things that Uh the EFF tends to to look at I think are fairly directly important to us,0.97,1.0
129,en-US,2303.6899328,22.5900544,Yes Um And also things that that may affect you know who Uh has access to the community Um in terms of like you know being able to to get on the Internet Exactly Exactly And that's something those are issues that they have made that work team could just say you know we endorse this we don't endorse that and that's fine,0.96,1.0
130,en-US,2326.4600064,16.579993599999998,And that's not even saying the whole community agrees with our views We're just saying the team agrees with this And Um that could happen from time to time as long as you know Um we discuss it Uh seriously and we want to take some action or we want to endorse something,0.98,1.0
131,en-US,2343.0500352,25.469952,I mean I think politics is a word that is so poisonous at the moment where it could have been something nicer where it could have been something where like I said earlier with nuance with trying Right Well there's use the civilized manner as well as as your analyst points out Um Uh politics as a word just refers to basically,0.96,1.0
132,en-US,2368.7299072,20.9801216,discussion of policy and In an ideal world you know discussing policy should not be something controversial or Uh Uh or toxic or whatever you know we should be able to you know have a reasonable say Uh you know discussions about our issues,0.97,1.0
133,en-US,2389.7100287999997,25.4101504,But Um there's also the colloquial definition of politics which is like that great lumbering beast which you dare not awaken by speaking its name Right Exactly So yeah it's not as black and white as we would like sometimes And in that regard now yeah I don't want people listening to this thinking oh my God I'm just going to,0.98,1.0
134,en-US,2415.3899008,16.3201024,you know Uh start picketing doing picket signs and Um galvanizing the community to engage in political activity No no Uh That has nothing to do with it I'm talking mostly about maybe a blog post saying hey we don't agree with you know people blocking net neutrality blah,0.98,1.0
135,en-US,2432.0401408,22.4698368,Right Not even Maybe yeah Yeah I think that's fine especially if the community is discussing it If they want us to say something about it we will Yeah And it might be Uh valuable for us to have like an explicitly labeled like opinion section like newspapers have Um where we can write editorials Uh that are expressing what we think about,0.96,1.0
136,en-US,2454.5099775999997,10.979942399999999,certain issues Uh or what members of the community think about certain issues That will be nice to engage in the community too and that in that regard So you know and it doesn't have to be a bad word It can actually be something really positive,0.96,1.0
137,en-US,2465.48992,20.8801792,And Um we can change each other's minds and we can grow etc. Right So yeah Yeah So I'm glad you sort of see it the same way Yeah Well Uh if I if I may segway into what I believe is our next topic Um the sort of that's the sort of like real world I want to say real world but,0.96,1.0
138,en-US,2487.3701376,30.589747199999998,Uh have made the wide world Uh international Uh Uh Uh All right Words fail me Um That's the non programing side of sort of a Uh yes Uh Underlying principle in human sociology which is Uh becoming very Um Uh single minded very dogmatic about something Um But of course we have plenty of experience with this in the programing world,0.96,1.0
139,en-US,2518.5699839999997,17.6900096,I can't even get started Right I mean Yeah Um And as you know I labeled this topic the art of persuasion And this has nothing to do with us trying to persuade anybody to do our bidding or to do what we I shouldn't even have said persuasion,0.95,1.0
140,en-US,2536.3501056,22.0397568,I'm interested in engaging Engaging people to change their mindsets or to Alan Webster said this too to sort of revise their beliefs you know Um Right You want to always revise your beliefs and make sure you're not falling into dogma and Uh programing fields right now are very tribalistic when it comes to communities,0.97,1.0
141,en-US,2558.3998976,20.5801472,Right Like here's our set of principles and rules Follow them If you don't you're not You know Um even I try to not have that with Hamade Even with Hamade it happens So Um I think it's important for us to sort of find a way to have people understand you know why do you think that you're deaf tool or,0.97,1.0
142,en-US,2578.9800448,19.989913599999998,you know Ed Emacs for quarter them Um your browser your operating system Why do you think that has anything to do with your identity Right Right Like people think I'm using them I'm using this browser I'm using the plug in vimperator for my browser I am a vain fan through and through,0.97,1.0
143,en-US,2599.209984,26.679910399999997,I'm able to So it's fascinating to me that they consider that as part of who they are And I think that is quite a dangerous way of thinking about Well yes So Uh I mean I was reading a discussion on Twitter the other day Um between two people Uh two programmers that I respect and they're talking about how Uh anti op,0.95,1.0
144,en-US,2625.9398656,21.8400768,has become almost as much of a cargo call as as op Um That's not like a burger It's probably true Like there are some people that are like that I think you've you've probably seen this as well Um And Uh you know it's an interesting point because Uh what I thought we've always been saying is that you know Uh object oriented programing,0.97,1.0
145,en-US,2647.7799424,16.7100416,is not a universal tool You know there are other tools out there Um but you know maintaining that they're both valid tools that you can use But I guess Uh you know that position can be taken to an extreme And you can say I would never use OPIS,0.96,1.0
146,en-US,2664.790016,16.859955199999998,Right Yeah Yeah And I still don't understand why we fall into that so often you know because it's Yeah Well it's an interesting Uh Uh piece of human psychology I think Like Um I don't want to say as much It happens,0.99,1.0
147,en-US,2681.8400256,22.1298688,Well I don't want to say programing is is uniquely afflicted by this Um There I've I've read articles from other fields that that are like talking about you know some Uh some concepts some Um paradigm Um that's been been latched onto by people in that field,0.96,1.0
148,en-US,2703.9698943999997,26.2500352,And they're like well why are we not considering you know this other way of thinking about things But you know maybe programing has it off worse than most Uh because we're already operating on a very ad hoc set of of Uh Uh ways of doing things like Um most most programmers Um learned how to how to code how to use computers just,0.99,1.0
149,en-US,2730.2199296,20.0701952,by like trying things and failing and reading things online And so you get this sort of like instinct Mm hmm That you have to rely on in terms of how things work Um And it's difficult to sort of rationalize like the idea that there are other ways to make things work,0.97,1.0
150,en-US,2750.8299776,12.540108799999999,It's almost a little bit superstitious I want to say Yeah And that's fascinating because that just brings us back to what if people were taught in a way where they know what's going on always like behind the scenes,0.99,1.0
151,en-US,2763.3999872,19.860070399999998,Yeah Right It's almost like well object oriented programing is is is fake I mean and by fake I always say the word fake because it helps jog my brain into thinking something more logically Because even when I program sometimes I fall into these documents where I fall fall into these paradigms that are not always going to be,0.97,1.0
152,en-US,2783.2600576,18.119884799999998,helpful for some some specific programing task And I have to say wait hold on You know OLP is is a paradigm and it's fake in the sense that it's been designed But again by humans because honestly when you see that computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another what does that,0.96,1.0
153,en-US,2801.3799424,21.1802112,have to do with you know the chips and the electronic pieces on your computer What does it have to do with Ram Right Well you with I mean yeah like with the way it's originally an abstraction for for A.I. It was designed so that Uh I could model the real world for the purposes of like reasoning about it,0.97,1.0
154,en-US,2822.5601536,19.249971199999997,or modeling simulations with Uh many different things in them And then someone decided that was going to be a good basis to design a language around where you can't do it any other way Uh And at that very moment it was taken to hospital,1.0,1.0
155,en-US,2841.8799615999997,10.8300288,Yeah Propaganda the way you promote it because you want to make money yourself But the books you write about it you know Um But when people say okay this was just one thing that like you said came out of an AI group I think it was as early as nineteen sixty,0.94,1.0
156,en-US,2853.850112,11.52,Um But this is the early seventies I think Oh no Maybe like maybe late 1950s when it comes to object oriented programing I think it's it made its first appearance like an MIT Um and it was a long time Yeah,0.95,1.0
157,en-US,2866.2099967999998,15.959859199999999,We're talking back in the last days with Uh I have the number nineteen seventy one in my head That might be right though Oh OK Yeah Yeah But you remember like the nineteen sixties similar Simula Sixty seven next subject you know it introduces the concept of objects there,0.91,0.99
158,en-US,2882.5300991999998,13.389823999999999,So Uh but the point is it comes from this place of you know it was based on some needs It was based on some things that just made it attractive for maybe applying it to other places But it was the way that it was market marketed,0.99,1.0
159,en-US,2895.9500288,17.6001024,Right And it's the way that people prefer to not go into the details of how I was made That causes a lot of this dogma to happen Right So maybe Yeah So like in terms of like designing a language around it,0.97,1.0
160,en-US,2913.5501311999997,17.369702399999998,Right It's it's basically taking one set of tradeoffs to the extreme Um You know so Uh like looking at like Sidorova Um you have Uh it's object oriented first of all So all of your code has to be in one object or another,0.95,1.0
161,en-US,2931.9098368,16.0700416,Um Yeah Which means absolutely That if if even if something doesn't quite fit into an object you have to stuff it in one Um And part of maybe why they did that was they wanted to be able to have you know automatically members managed memory,0.98,1.0
162,en-US,2948.9098752,19.380224,Um But that doesn't necessarily follow Um You don't have to have garbage collection or you have to have objects to have garbage collection Um And then also you get like Um Uh code reuse through inheritance Uh But that also is not inherently tied to object oriented programing either,0.98,1.0
163,en-US,2968.2900992,17.7600512,You can have Uh code reuse in other ways You can have subtyping in other ways Um Yeah but when you when they decide to put all these things together and then that was the only way people were taught to think about these things suddenly they became intricately linked,0.99,1.0
164,en-US,2986.1398528,19.3101824,And Um if anyone suggested doing things differently or not following the idiom of that you were sort of challenging the notion that that was how things are done And I think that's sort of part of why you get that sort of Um cult like mentality around,0.99,1.0
165,en-US,3005.4699008,14.690099199999999,It's very systematic and becomes very system systemized Right It's almost like this just the way things are honey You know it's institutionalized initialized Yeah that's the right word And and the thing is then you build things on top of that right,0.9,1.0
166,en-US,3020.1899008,17.0100736,You have something like pattern creational patterns Uh structural patterns Um that if I want to break that down creation of patterns I mean you know the factory method pattern Right The singleton pattern the builder pattern the prototype pattern things that just make your life easier if,0.95,1.0
167,en-US,3038.1000704,17.5200256,Well these are things that makes like Right Um Well yeah it feels nice to use too And it's almost like it's it's it's ways of solving its known ways of solving problems But the problem is its known ways of solving problems that only exist because of the way these languages chose to do,0.94,1.0
168,en-US,3056.2500608,17.669939199999998,Yeah that too Um Yeah And yeah Oh God I mean we could we could dove into this Premiere But my point Yeah my point was I think is your point too is like this is this is all something that came as a toolset for people to solve something,0.98,1.0
169,en-US,3074.1598208,15.1502848,Right And Uh if you understand again how things actually work on your computer you're more like OK this is just one thing This is just one way to do something I could use another Mm hmm Yeah Well and talking about when you know all of this background and history of how computers work in the history of computing on,0.97,1.0
170,en-US,3089.3101056,11.6998144,this designers and you look into the lives of these language designers it's almost like OK I could be one of these people or Um whatever I see here it's almost like I get it You know it's it's it's one,0.99,1.0
171,en-US,3101.3101567999997,11.52,One possibility I can choose another And that's so freeing Uh That's what I want to say That's a very freeing mindset to have And you almost feel when you look back to how you were before it's almost like holy shit,0.99,1.0
172,en-US,3113.1299839999997,10.8900352,Like why was I always obsessed with patterns I don't get it And it's almost like I can't even imagine myself thinking that way anymore But I was part of it And I remember the day that I sort of broke out of that,1.0,1.0
173,en-US,3124.0200191999998,24.8399872,You know when I came into NASSI it's almost like I'm free you know So Um I'm not sure when that had happened with you I remember very well but Um I know you well Yeah So Uh Um Uh for me it was mostly related to Uh finding Henneman Hero but I hadn't been too deep into it Uh beforehand because Uh you know I'm I'm pretty,0.97,1.0
174,en-US,3148.8600063999997,29.760102399999997,young Uh Hamade Hero started when I was 17 So I'd only been programing seriously for like two or three years before that Um But Um what I thought of while you were talking was that Um in terms of persuading people Um trying to convince people about Um new ideas or Uh changing their viewpoint Um there's this this concept called Um Uh frames Um where you you have a,0.97,1.0
175,en-US,3178.6201088,23.3398272,certain Um frame through which you look at the world So Um we might say that op is a frame because you view things in terms of OK is this language OPIS is this other language not Adobe Um And the way to really convince a lot of people over a long period of time is to change the way things are framed,0.97,1.0
176,en-US,3201.9599359999997,13.4100992,So rather than framing things around OPIS you might try to frame things around functional programing or in our case we're trying to frame things around handmaid I want I want to add to that because it's not just about framing,0.96,1.0
177,en-US,3215.6100607999997,17.8798592,It's also about shattering preconceived notions I like something I did when I started You know being active online was my programing streams on Twitch I'm sure you remember that Um It's Uh Uh something I would do is tell people you know hey I work for NASA,0.96,1.0
178,en-US,3233.6699392,14.8801536,And but at the same time I would be silly and I would drink and I would make a lot of mistakes In programing or I would not take it seriously and people would see me as human beings almost like oh OK so NASA doesn't have you know Uh a place full of geniuses in lab coats,0.97,1.0
179,en-US,3249.1200512,13.5899136,Look at this Look at this dumb drunk Do it on the Internet right That's powder's that's how does a lot of uh you know you lose me It's almost like ah you know I had these ideas of what it's like,0.97,1.0
180,en-US,3262.9499904,13.570048,And that's absolutely it isn't that way Right So it's not only what you just said about framing issues in a threatening way it's almost it's also about saying hey by the way Um whatever you're seeing here in this language or whatever you're hearing from these people guess what,0.96,1.0
181,en-US,3276.550144,13.969817599999999,You know Um you could have been one of them or you could have this could have gone right Well the opposite direction Like I said this before But it's so important for people to realize that all of this that we're talking about is design made by us,0.98,1.0
182,en-US,3290.7900928,11.129856,It's something that we are taking physics and we are building systems but they are our way of interpreting how to make them And it could have gone it could have gone a vastly different direction So when that knowledge is there,0.99,1.0
183,en-US,3301.9199488,21.6901632,Right Um it shatters a lot of stuff It shatters a lot of notions So yeah this is this is actually something I forgot about I wanted to talk about earlier in terms of the handmaid ideology is we for a little while Um we said that we were against abstraction which is not entirely true,0.98,1.0
184,en-US,3325.0701311999997,27.5499008,Um Yeah Yeah Uh Actually what we what what we say is that we're against always using existing abstractions Um I think Uh Uh what I've seen Uh throughout Um as I'm as I'm going through more and more complicated classes Uh at university is that it is pretty much impossible to think about large scale problems without abstracting Um this is the way the human brain works,0.97,1.0
185,en-US,3352.620032,17.669939199999998,We can't focus on that many things at a time Uh and keep them all in our head and have other people be on the same page all of the time You need to be able to condense things into a single symbol that interacts in certain ways,1.0,1.0
186,en-US,3371.0700543999997,21.7800704,But that doesn't mean you always have to use the abstractions that are currently being used or that someone else came up with Um And in fact what we argue is is often that the kinds of abstractions you want to use are in fact specific to a project Um and that each project needs to consider what the best abstraction is,0.99,1.0
187,en-US,3392.8501248,18.5397248,for it You know that's I I couldn't agree more Um And it's an interesting way to put it I actually didn't think of it that way but that's exactly right And even even in your own code if you if you were to give code life you know let it breathe Um that the degree of direct knowledge that one component,0.97,1.0
188,en-US,3411.3898495999997,14.490009599999999,or module has of another that degree varies Right And yeah And you choose to vary those degrees because again the abstractions matter Um whenever you want to swap pieces or whenever you want people to share Uh your very large code bases,0.98,1.0
189,en-US,3425.8798592,18.210201599999998,So that's something we value is what you're trying to say It's like yeah And we used to say that in the beginning but it's like we we said it wrong We were trying to say no We think that having components not how complete knowledge of each other or behind the scenes knowledge is fine,0.98,1.0
190,en-US,3444.2100735999998,12.6599168,This instructions it's OK It's just the fact that they we want to always choose the ones we have forever That's not right You know we yeah we haven't we haven't got into a place where we know that we can't even decide that,0.94,1.0
191,en-US,3456.8699904,20.1302016,Can you say that officials can remain you know eternal or for 10 20 30 years with the way hardware changes in the walls No You always want to improve Right So when people consider Um libraries like Isdell which is great I like it Um Uh as as a formal motion graphics libraries,0.92,1.0
192,en-US,3477.7198592,22.3801344,Um I just mentioned two classic ones When you have when you have libraries like that and you consider them to be a solid problem you know that's what we're against Um Right Pretty much And vastly improved Right So Uh what the basically the issue here is that is that creating abstractions is a skill,0.98,1.0
193,en-US,3500.2802176,25.6196608,And like any skill it takes practice And you'll never get practice if you always use the abstractions that exist And it is hugely important when a new technology comes along or when technology reaches a certain point of evolution past its last design like phase that the new abstractions that are created for it work well,0.98,1.0
194,en-US,3527.6697599999998,19.4404352,Um Like for example Um Uh Uh an operating system Um is an abstraction and it's an abstraction that was primarily evolving on desktop computers for 30 years Um And then mobile phones came along and nobody knew how to make that obstruction because they were very different,0.99,1.0
195,en-US,3549.0598912,12.349849599999999,Um But Uh it is critical when looking at something like that to be able to create new abstractions and not just try to adapt existing ones that aren't going to work very well Um And that's that's sort of a Large-Scale example,0.98,1.0
196,en-US,3561.4199808,19.9200768,But this is the buzzer and the buzzer OK Uh That's a Large-Scale example But this applies any time you're solving a new problem I think Um because it's trying to approach the problem in the way that is most useful to that problem,0.96,1.0
197,en-US,3581.9401215999997,16.979968,Hmm Yes Yeah I agree with that You know Um when you say that I'm thinking of a word right now Uh which is using computer programing coupling Right Like a software engineering coupling is I guess how closely connected to teams or modules are,0.98,1.0
198,en-US,3599.9997952,21.840281599999997,Um And it's used a lot in object oriented programing too So you know we're also talking about not just coupling in programing but coupling in general with Uh how you choose to change something or not And I think what I'm trying to say is and what you're trying to say what we said many things but Uh something we're trying to,0.98,1.0
199,en-US,3621.8400767999997,14.6399232,say recently I think we can summarize it as Um hey make sure that what you see in your code base whether at work whether it's a personal project make sure you see it as something that was Uh copied in a certain way Uh obstruct it in a certain direction,0.94,1.0
200,en-US,3636.7499264,15.509913599999999,And that can always change and be improved And when you do it you get practice And when you do it as a programmer and you get to create new things if you stick with the current way the current way things are copied if you stick with it you will not be able to create Uh innovative software projects or,0.99,1.0
201,en-US,3652.2598399999997,23.6101632,innovative Uh Uh directions of how to develop software You want to be able to and this is actually Yeah this is this is something I think Um I'm thinking about now Um that we really want to emphasize in our Uh as we create educational material for him in Newark is we want to be able to teach these skills,0.98,1.0
202,en-US,3676.8899072,25.500057599999998,Um You know being able to create new abstractions being able to design Um APIs being able to reason about things on a higher level Correct Um Absolutely true And I think that's that's pretty central to to why we want to have educational materials is we're trying to get people to think more broadly about these things more broadly more critically less,0.99,1.0
203,en-US,3702.3899647999997,21.259878399999998,dogmatic Um revising whatever you revising your beliefs All of these things are essential to handmaid And Um it's funny that in the past if we have people listening in right now like I want to say Sam Barrett Sam McGrath these are people who will Uh let me say my name,0.92,1.0
204,en-US,3723.6600832,15.480012799999999,So you have Sean McGrath Sam Barrett Jonathan Blow to see more Tory Um even Stephanie Hope I forget her last name Gece Hurlbut Thank you Um And you know you have all the developers who the Hamade Network community usually admires,0.9,1.0
205,en-US,3739.4399231999996,14.910259199999999,And they like the way that they program because they they consider everything we've been talking about as natural like Right Yeah They are routinely thinking on that higher level of of what abstractions do I need to solve my problem,0.98,1.0
206,en-US,3755.7301248,18.6896384,Um What Uh is actually like required in this design space Um And and what what they've done in engaging with the community is is sort of make that process a little bit more transparent to to the rest of us Oh yeah,0.97,1.0
207,en-US,3774.72,11.610111999999999,Because apparently they need to do it because nobody else is doing it Um or you know not nobody else but there's very little people actually doing that kind of thing Right Well well I'm in university and a computer science program,0.97,1.0
208,en-US,3786.3301119999996,24.1197056,And what they definitely don't teach you here Um is I'm going to say this a little quietly in case someone over here Uh is if they don't teach you Uh how to approach problems in general they give you the algorithms they give you the project frameworks,0.95,1.0
209,en-US,3812.1000959999997,33.470054399999995,Um It's all very designed to make it easy for you to go and join an existing software project Um But that's a very sort of short term view I feel like Um in that that's that you're it's basically like Um Treating computer science as Uh a computer science degree as like a trade school certification,0.99,1.0
210,en-US,3846.3500288,19.9200768,Right Uh You are qualified to go do this exact job and that's it Whereas I feel sorry Go on I feel like I mean we could get into a whole rat hole on on computer science education And we're nearing an hour here,1.0,1.0
211,en-US,3866.2701055999996,26.5199616,So I'm not going to kill you But Uh I actually I probably shouldn't go much further because I could go on this forever But that's fine But you're Uh essentially essentially what I'm saying is we should be encouraging this this higher-level think because not just in programing like being able to think about things that are Uh at a higher level,0.95,1.0
212,en-US,3892.7900671999996,23.5298816,more critically is super important to being an intelligent person in general Yeah that's the point of college You know presumably Um Yeah Yeah And Uh it's it's fascinating that we're we're at a point where you and I have to talk about this as if it's it's almost depressing you know as Um Um we grew up,0.98,1.0
213,en-US,3916.3400192,19.020185599999998,I always tell you right Uh offline that we live in a dystopian computing society Right It's almost like why are we why are we in this current state Like what happened And I can never pinpoint what happened but I know that we we damn will have to do something about it,0.98,1.0
214,en-US,3935.3602048,19.2598016,And that's how we're doing all of these efforts ourselves because Yeah Yeah Yeah Well I don't know if if I would necessarily say that the programing community is much worse off than any other given field Um That's a fair statement,0.98,1.0
215,en-US,3955.0398464,15.8101504,Primarily I think what a disadvantage is Um is that it's such a new field that we haven't really had time to figure out Um OK how do we get rid of old ideas and bring in new ones Right Um We're kind of stuck at the moment,0.99,1.0
216,en-US,3971.6798464,16.0301056,Um Yeah And there's different groups of people doing different types of branching off to where computing should go And we just another branch I'll admit that you know it's almost like hey you know it's Yeah And let me let me draw a parallel to try to substantiate that,0.97,1.0
217,en-US,3988.1900032,25.260032,Um So psychology is also a fairly new field Um last century or two Um And there's sort of been a very paradigmatic shift in psychology over the past like 50 years Um where they went from a model where they primarily tried to figure things out by just like doing therapy all the time to bring in like neuroscience and genetics and all,0.99,1.0
218,en-US,4013.4500352,18.6601472,this other stuff And it totally changed how You know psychologists look at human brains Um and that's the sort of thing I think we need to have Right is is something that completely changes the way we look at computers,0.98,1.0
219,en-US,4032.1400832,23.579852799999998,That would be amazing And this has happened somewhere else not that you mentioned They think of linguistics Um If there's a paradigm shift in existence I would say it's bio linguistics Right Imbil linguistics They're shifting the focus of like investigating linguistics Uh just like behaviorally or based on studies to something that embraces I guess like in sciences and natural,0.94,1.0
220,en-US,4055.719936,18.749849599999997,sciences Um And that makes a framework where you can understand that like they found the fundamentals of how things work in language And it's it's an interesting way to look at things And by the way it's a collaboration between not only a linguist but you have biologists obviously and neuroscientists and psychologists mathematicians,0.95,1.0
221,en-US,4074.5000959999998,17.07008,Yeah I think I think interdisciplinary work is is hugely important in the future Often programmers don't Uh Uh give enough weight to that That's my point you know Yeah I mean being a programmer and something else Yeah And let's bring again Jonathan Blau,0.95,1.0
222,en-US,4093.3101567999997,18.8997632,Um He is a very good game designer and he is also a great programmer And he's mixed those two Um In a way it is fascinating to the community but Um I think in some ways he's also Um a philosopher Um and an artist and Um a renaissance maybe a little bit a writer,0.97,1.0
223,en-US,4113.1401215999995,26.399948799999997,Uh It's I'm not trying to to Uh glorify John Jonathan Blow here I'm just Um using him as an example of why we should Be try to be more broadly engaged than just in programing Um because that can give you you know tunnel vision that can that can make it harder to to think about things in new ways,0.96,1.0
224,en-US,4139.6199424,12.750028799999999,Something yeah something something I've been thinking about And we can close the topic with this is and I just got this idea Um in my head So not only just courses for having that work we could also do something in the lines of,0.98,1.0
225,en-US,4153.5000576,20.2002432,You know I've been Uh like I said I've been at NASA for three years now and it's completely revolutionized the way I saw programing computers Right because of the nature of Um Um You know I was telling Jonathan Blow this Uh a few days ago you know a buffer overrun could kill an astronaut and you know if it goes you know,0.98,1.0
