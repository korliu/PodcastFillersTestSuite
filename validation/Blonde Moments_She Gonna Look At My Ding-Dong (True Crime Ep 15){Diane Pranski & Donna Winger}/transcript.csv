200,en-US,3013.8099712,11.9701504,And that's where the second shot was fired where there was a much bigger area of blood and that was where he was left None of this is adding up anymore Then they analyzed the blood spatter from the hammer,0.99,1.0
201,en-US,3025.8100224,13.23008,There was no blood spatter on Roger's shirt at all And where he was said to fall backwards wasn't possible either from where he was laying OK so there was blood spatter from Donna that didn't just didn't match where Mark said it happened,0.99,1.0
202,en-US,3039.0401024,16.709836799999998,And one of the splatter castoff was on Mark's sleeve and that meant that he was much closer to her than he claimed to be during said attack Then they also blood splatter Mm hmm Then they also found evidence that Mark invited Roger to come over that day,0.98,1.0
203,en-US,3055.7499392,14.460108799999999,And Roger's roommates verified that they told police that Mark had called for a meeting time for him to come to their house And there was even a note written by Roger with the time and their address in his car that verified everything,1.0,1.0
204,en-US,3070.2399487999996,13.5901184,So basically he had told him oh hey come over and we'll discuss this and maybe you can get your job back Basically that was how he got him to come over which is why he just came in there and said his coffee cup and his cigarets on the table,0.99,1.0
