4,en-US,63.36,10.44,But still we try to like kind of like shy away from talking about it So yeah happy to be here Thanks for having me All right Well do you even blog Podcast I was listening to it on my morning walk this morning,0.98,1.0
5,en-US,73.8300032,18.0299968,I've been listening to podcasts for 10 years as part of my morning routine is how I learn And Um I was listening to an episode you did with Nick Lopa about why his product launch fell flat So we're going to talk about Nick and then we're going to talk about your own projects that have failed,0.97,1.0
6,en-US,91.86,10.5899968,But Uh if you're listening to this in your earbuds after you listen to this I want you to go find that Do you even blog podcasts and find the Nick Lopa episode if you want to go deeper on what we're going to talk about,0.96,1.0
7,en-US,102.9899968,16.58,But Nick Sloper he has his own podcast called Side Hustle Nation I think it's called Uh Why did his course project fail or his product launch fail Yeah So the one minute of context is this Nick and I were actually skiing together,0.97,1.0
8,en-US,119.58000639999999,10.5299968,I was more like falling down the mountain Nick was actually skiing And we got to talk about like oh I remember you were working on a course and a lunch like last year like six months ago How'd it go,0.97,1.0
9,en-US,130.49999359999998,14.5200128,And he was like did not well He ended up making like ten or fifteen thousand animatronic under the bus here Ten or fifteen thousand dollars But his audience is pretty substantial like he was expecting a lot more like that's that's good revenue,0.99,1.0
10,en-US,145.0200064,12.629990399999999,But his audience was like 30 40 50 thousand people that he initially pitched this to So there's a context Pretty big audience Smart guy too by the way like a very loyal audience They do meet ups with him,0.95,1.0
11,en-US,157.6499968,18.6899968,His Facebook group is like really interactive It's an incredibly engaging audience Why didn't this work there And we were talking about this and were brainstorming I have two theories I think everybody could take something away from these Number one was that it wasn't sexy,0.94,1.0
12,en-US,176.6099968,12.479999999999999,I hate to use that work It's a little weird but it was very valuable It was very useful His product had something to do with OK I'm going from zero to side hustle I want a side hustle I want some side hustle income,0.93,1.0
13,en-US,189.5099904,14.910003199999998,And that product was talking about getting into some freelancing and not even like really sexy seven figure freelancing I've got an agency I'm getting like 7000 gigs It's kind of on the more realistic side and just like earning some cash there,0.94,1.0
14,en-US,204.75000319999998,11.04,Nobody wants that I'm raising my hand right now like no one wants that We want the quick and easy cash We want the quote unquote passive income and stuff And the more we thought about it as discourse was solid,0.95,1.0
15,en-US,216.03000319999998,14.549990399999999,Nick's a great teacher He's carrying the service component was there It was not sexy People didn't want it It may have been what people needed but people did not want it That's number one And number two I think we're going to go deeper into this,0.98,1.0
16,en-US,231.04,17.599999999999998,This is first launch He opened up like a little beta to a smaller group and he did like a few like many launches to different segments of his audience But in general it was the first offer It was the first iteration V1 version one of this product of this course or whatnot,0.96,1.0
17,en-US,248.9700096,17.7299968,And one of our big takeaways was most people fall flat on their first product launch The first course the first membership whatever it is it doesn't mean you should like abandon it completely It means you analyze you learn you optimize you iterate you make it better for the next time et cetera et cetera,0.94,1.0
18,en-US,266.73000959999996,18.96,And so part of what we kind of left with that episode and people got listed is OK And now what to do going forward Learn from the mistakes yada yada I mean we all know this but putting it into practice on any given day week or month with our courses and with our products probably pretty difficult,0.96,1.0
19,en-US,285.7200128,13.679974399999999,So those are my my big two takeaways from Uh that challenge Kudos to him for letting me like throw him under the bus repeatedly He's a great guy Yeah it's it is a great episode Check that out Do you even blog podcasts,0.95,1.0
20,en-US,299.5799808,19.140019199999998,And I think that there's a framework I use called Um well there's like vitamin versus pill which is like painkiller versus vitamin is another way to say it or solution versus suggestion sexy versus Uh not so sexy or whatever And I mean I think about that as a marketer,0.96,1.0
21,en-US,318.71999999999997,16.8299776,I'm always looking for sexy like in software as an example If if we've refactored the code and made all this stuff more performant or like cleaned up the database or whatever that is not sexy Yeah So you got a sexy does matter,0.97,1.0
22,en-US,335.5699968,18.929996799999998,And also Um the other cool thing I thought about your interview with Nick was he was already successful in other online income stuff like podcast sponsorship and whatever So now just because you're doing one thing well it doesn't mean OK I'm going to do this other type of online business and it's just going to work just as well,0.97,1.0
23,en-US,354.4999936,15.3299968,or whatever like But I do admire that's what they give you You have to have a healthy relationship with failure especially if you're going to build multiple streams of income because you're not just building one thing you're building lots of things which just amplifies the amount of failure you have to pass through,0.98,1.0
24,en-US,370.32998399999997,15.4600192,Now what Uh is your relationship with failure And by the way dude is prolific Uh What did you say How many courses have you made Uh Oh probably like between 30 and 40 over the past three years I was actually it's I'm I'm actually making eight,0.93,1.0
25,en-US,385.9399936,13.7700096,Another course hopefully is my last one for a while calling it quits and focusing on what's working Uh But right now it's called content everywhere And it's my my course on promoting and repurposing content So I was extra on add up,0.95,1.0
26,en-US,400.2799872,10.1700352,I'm bragging here I'm totally bragging I'm starting to add up how many blog posts to podcasts and YouTube videos I've done I lost count around three hundred over the past three years Uh I don't actually know what it's like,0.92,1.0
27,en-US,410.45002239999997,12.2399744,But if if I have any strength as being prolific what Well what's failed Yeah go ahead You were going to say something else that's going to I was going to jump into your actual question which is Yeah speak to your failures,0.92,1.0
28,en-US,423.2300032,18.8599808,The true answer is 90 percent of it So I have a good self promoter I have a membership community it's called on that impact It used to be called something different And the story I like to tell about failure is I think most people can learn from this particular product,0.92,1.0
29,en-US,442.1499904,16.649984,Right now it's a membership community There are some courses in there It's pretty standard digital product info product business for content creators Well I actually started that three years ago like literally like three months Um to do even what three months after I started this entire business,0.97,1.0
30,en-US,459.7300224,14.6399744,Uh I launched this product I'll watch this There were I don't know like 700 people on the email list and it made a few thousand dollars like 20 I think it was a 2300 dollars or something like that which at the time I was like oh yeah hold the phone does awesome,0.91,1.0
31,en-US,474.94000639999996,14.4600064,And so I thought it was a success Then I did again like six months later maybe three six months later and it made like a little bit of money like nine hundred bucks or something like that There's only one or two more people to buy,0.99,1.0
32,en-US,489.85000959999996,13.609983999999999,And I was like failure done I'm quitting Like that's it That didn't work out Move on to the next thing What's the next course What's the next product What's the next membership like What's the next thing And I tried a bunch of different stuff,0.99,1.0
33,en-US,503.4699776,13.2599808,There's some other failures in there And I went on to the next thing and then I went to the next thing And people were telling me this entire time like focus entrepreneurship on my business especially like focus is critical,0.96,1.0
34,en-US,517.2400127999999,17.4000128,And people say that all the time And I'm like oh you're right That's great I told you that I need to focus And what they didn't tell me was what exactly that meant So part of me is like oh I need to focus on do you have a blog like no other side businesses no other side hustles,0.96,1.0
35,en-US,534.6400256,9.8099712,or whatever I was doing that and I was like why are my products working Like I keep launching things I keep trying new things Some of them make a little bit of money Some of them don't like why what's going on here,0.98,1.0
36,en-US,544.9900031999999,11.459993599999999,And no one really told me like there were different levels of focus And we mentioned Nick's failure Like that was the first time he launched this product First time I started launching these products that were kind of like mediocre results,0.96,1.0
37,en-US,557.1400192,11.9099904,And so it took me two and a half years Actually it was July 2019 So a little over a year ago at the time we were recording this I had just gone through a what I would consider the worst failure,0.98,1.0
38,en-US,569.289984,11.970048,It was a product nobody wanted Nobody needed I was charging way too little for it And it was completely it was hard to sell It was a it was a workshop I called it the affiliate workshop And no one wanted it,0.99,1.0
39,en-US,581.260032,12.809984,No one cared There's like 10 people that bought in I made like a thousand dollars This is going to end up like months of my time Hello As terrible as freaking out I was Uh I was talking to my my number two Rhiner,0.93,1.0
40,en-US,594.4300032,14.4600064,I was like what is going on Like why does Pete stink at this Like what's what's happening And so we had a a come to Jesus moment Forgive the expression where I took a walk for like three and a half hours on the phone with right now and just like try to dig into what's going on like,0.94,1.0
41,en-US,609.6699904,13.2900352,all these failures that have been happening like why can't I seem to make any of this work And then I think this is a big take away She asked me she was like what's the business you you want to run like your dream business,0.96,1.0
42,en-US,622.9600256,15.7999616,And in fact at the time Avengers Endgame I think had Uh recently come out So we called it the Thanis Infinity gantlet business If you haven't seen the movie it's where he snaps his fingers and you can kind of make happen whatever he wants which is if you have the Thanos Infinity gantlet you snap your fingers,0.96,1.0
43,en-US,638.8300287999999,12.5399552,What would your business look like The perfect not like in a realistic world like totally ideal That is like OK well let me think about that Let's brainstorm that or whatnot And again just was walking talking thinking things through,0.94,1.0
44,en-US,651.9099904,11.6400128,And after three and half hours I remember that very first product launch that I brought up It was called Blog Are you back then And I was like I actually liked that And it worked There are 700 people on my email list,0.96,1.0
45,en-US,663.820032,13.2599808,My business was like three or four months old I mean like twenty three hundred bucks which is not like seven figures But it was brand new the first time done It was working And so I actually decided to bring that back which was a little awkward,0.98,1.0
46,en-US,677.4399999999999,12.359987199999999,I threw away everything else that I was working on I focus on this one thing that I actually wanted and I launched it and it was mediocre results again But I was OK with that I was like you know what I'm going to learn from this,0.99,1.0
47,en-US,690.1899776,14.000025599999999,I'm going to figure out what didn't work what did work yada yada and do this again And then I'm a do it again And we just did our third launch And it's growing It's not like seven figures yet but we're getting new people in every time the people we've gotten into,0.95,1.0
48,en-US,704.6500351999999,20.339968,The product is starting to take shape over time And we'll say that again like the product is just now starting to take shape over time And it's really been like three years in the making So that level of focus right there I think is the biggest contributing factor to most of my like failed launches failed products and,0.95,1.0
49,en-US,724.9900031999999,11.6099584,that sort of stuff Hopefully that answered your question somewhere in there Yeah that definitely does So what is this Is this so-called blog or you or is it called something else It's called online IMPAC now online mpact And what is it like,0.94,1.0
50,en-US,736.809984,14.9900288,What do you what's inside the box as a course As a membership as a coaching program Does it have worksheets or office hours or what's in the box All the above which also makes it more difficult to sell on ways,0.94,1.0
51,en-US,752.1999872,12.3300352,Yeah So that they get access to all my courses I'd have just like this library of content at this point that they get access to And I do sell those on a cart as well But this is kind of like a you know everything's included in a membership fee,0.95,1.0
52,en-US,765.2199936,12.8500224,And then we have an actual community component which sounds a little silly And I never I didn't actually think that was valuable until I had a critical mass of people to actually make it work What was the critical mass number for you,0.99,1.0
53,en-US,778.0900352,17.459968,Like approximately how many people Right around 100 OK Right around 400 That amount of people I don't know if you've heard of this This is a site tangent you've heard of like the was like 90 10 one roll or something where 90 percent of people are literally just lurking on social media,0.94,1.0
54,en-US,795.5500032,15.1500288,In your membership community 10 percent are responding to stuff you post or whatever One percent is actually like creating your post and asking questions or whatever Yeah So there's only like five to 10 people Max who are like engaging,0.94,1.0
55,en-US,810.88,9.4199808,But there's a ton of lurkers that are like in there And I'll get emails like oh yeah no I'm still here I've been paying your money I'm still here I'm still learning I'm lurking like OK well there you go,0.96,1.0
56,en-US,820.9599999999999,15.84,Anyway side tangent Yeah right around 100 people So it's courses and it's a community component And then we do Uh twice monthly group goals and like goals And I also have like an add on where people can purchase like a coaching call with Raita like my number two that I told you about,0.93,1.0
57,en-US,836.8,16.3500032,She's a certified coach and then a website and blog about it from me which is more what I'm better suited for Uh And yeah that's pretty much it's kind of it's pretty well rounded What's your take on courses versus membership with lots of content,0.95,1.0
58,en-US,853.1500032,22.9799936,And maybe you do all lakha like you have like So for example Um something like Uh Jeff Walker's product launch formula It's like the same Uh I call that like a signature course or Amy Porter Field's Uh digital course Academi It's like the same thing Emori for lios the school or whatever like some people have these like and actually some of,0.92,1.0
59,en-US,876.1299968,15.619993599999999,those are more like coaching programs But what what brought you to I'm going to instead of having this giant course I'm going to do a membership with a bunch of stuff in there Well it's funny This is another lesson learned from failure and it's going to answer your question,0.99,1.0
60,en-US,891.7600256,12.570009599999999,So that first online MPack launch after that they know something and gotten the call and months of kind of rebuilding this program that I kind of already did like three years ago Uh I expected it to be the bigger thing,0.9,1.0
61,en-US,904.5999615999999,14.7800064,I was expecting more people And I have for like every launch I thought it was going to be like my audience has gotten a lot bigger over the past couple of years This is a great product I believe in it like a million percent that really helps to sell things and convince people it's awesome,0.96,1.0
62,en-US,919.8900223999999,17.0399744,And it was still just like little by little growth And I was like what I was expecting the big school I want to be a Marine for the billion dollar losses or whatnot It's not like that And even over the past Um almost a year now over the past year doing all that impact I realize,0.94,1.0
63,en-US,938.1699583999999,11.460096,This is the metaphor that we already mentioned I call it the dog pill versus the dog treat like the sexy versus what people need Yeah dogs don't want the dog pill You actually have to like literally wrap it in a dog,0.96,1.0
64,en-US,949.6300544,18.9599744,Peanut butter Yeah So online impact is the unsexy work like it is the dog pill I know what people need like these these creators and bloggers and podcasters that come to my community They need accountability They need to pay me every month and have me bug them to take action and do those things,0.98,1.0
65,en-US,968.5900287999999,13.5099392,Like everybody kind of understands that but nobody wants that Like I know nobody buys my membership because like yeah I know what I need to do They pay me to help them do that And by the way it works like anything I've ever lost,0.95,1.0
66,en-US,982.1200384,11.9399424,All those courses all those products This is the thing that gets the most results But it's also the most difficult to sell because it's the duckbill To answer your question what I've done over the past six months and again,0.99,1.0
67,en-US,995.010048,10.1999616,I'm not the seven figure guy I'm not the big score guy yet but I've just started to like kind of work this out of my own business is to have both And you mentioned Amy Porterfield so I'm Amy Porterfield,0.96,1.0
68,en-US,1006.0499967999999,12.780032,Uh A year ago was going hard on her membership component I think it was I'm not sure what order she sold in I think the membership was sold on the back end of her of course I don't remember exactly but she was going hard on this,0.96,1.0
69,en-US,1019.5500032,13.9199488,And for me I think it's going to have to be the same thing So all that impact the membership community for me is for the people who it's not cold traffic It's not even my warm audience It's for people who have bought my courses,0.99,1.0
70,en-US,1033.4999552,14.5900544,It's for people who have been with me for a couple of years It's a backhander offer It is the back end offer And it's going to grow slow It's not going to be like an overnight thing But feeding into that I've determined for me you don't have the one thing yet,0.95,1.0
71,en-US,1048.1399807999999,20.1299968,I have to have two main products and funnels when I'm done podcasting It's called pod course And the other one is on systems and productivity specifically with content production I mentioned content everywhere I have a tool called when our blog posts and then that is just like little mini product funnel the self-liquidating offer the slick slow funnel,0.93,1.0
72,en-US,1068.7500287999999,11.550003199999999,And both of those things lead into the membership Again this is this is really fresh and new for me personally This has only been the past six months that I've really been putting this into action But that's my current theory,1.0,1.0
73,en-US,1081.4599168,14.460108799999999,That's cool And what Um just so we have context you've mentioned three years is have you really have you like been in the online world as Uh for only three years or longer than that or what's the time like What's your personal timeline,0.98,1.0
