48,en-US,689.92,11.459993599999999,Because you're right Like I know you're getting into But it's so it's all relative to their level of success right It's just like oh my gosh Like I'm only making three hundred fifty million dollars Right You know what I mean,0.96,1.0
49,en-US,701.3799935999999,14.490009599999999,Like it's like compared to how did Uh where did she get to be so popular that she can make 800 million Uh It's just it's just so interesting how how quickly you know things like that can happen Um But anyway that was aside from going on a Kardashian tangent,0.98,1.0
50,en-US,715.8900224,19.0899712,Yeah I was actually so I was reading that Forbes article So Shopify was making just in terms of Um Uh commissions a year on on on the fulfillment and everything They were making a little over five hundred and fifty thousand dollars on these commissions Um just for doing very little essentially,0.97,1.0
51,en-US,735.219968,19.1399936,Yeah Um but yeah Crazy crazy stuff Yeah Well you mentioned that you're working into you're going to get into the design period here once the summer's done or whatever And I wanted to talk to you about that Um because you have some designs where you design them obviously and then you have some designs like you hire out illustrators or,0.99,1.0
52,en-US,754.3599616,15.0900736,whatever What's the percentage there like Well first off let me ask one other question first How many new designs do you typically introduce like in a new season or something like that Uh You know too many Usually it's about and definitely not all by mine by myself,0.96,1.0
53,en-US,769.4500352,13.619968,It's like about 80 which is a bit of a bad habit to be honest It shouldn't be that much because I think I think I think in a lot of ways it's just been throwing a bunch of stuff against the wall and see what sticks,0.99,1.0
54,en-US,783.1099904,12.7699968,Yeah I mean you always kind of go with what you think is Uh based on what's going on trending wise or based on Um what is sort of done well in the past And you know you kind of recreate some of that,0.99,1.0
55,en-US,795.8799872,11.0700032,But at the same time you know you may have executed it while you may have executed poorly And then sometimes stuff you just didn't even anticipate does well you know so I'm always I'm always doing too much stuff,0.99,1.0
56,en-US,806.9499903999999,12.0300032,So I would say you know what Uh a lot of it I don't really have a lot of time to design even in this kind of scope Uh Uh Like with Colin I we kind of get together for ideas calling Uh gantlets a friend of mine,1.0,1.0
57,en-US,818.9799936,14.0100096,And he's an amazing designer He's a really great illustrator which is not my strong point And so he Uh we get together and I have some ideas and he has ideas and we kind of just meet for an afternoon and kind of basically hash it out,0.99,1.0
58,en-US,832.9999872,14.390016,Yeah I just want to take a little bit of credit here that I introduce Colin you did So you did You can take all of my 10 percent your 10 percent you know butterfly kiss not from even the butterfly but Uh yeah,0.91,1.0
59,en-US,847.3900031999999,15.929958399999999,I mean Um Yeah So we do that And then there's other people you know there's actually you know there's a lot of people I've worked with Um Gibby Bryant the Uh atomic child is great doom And who's in Uh the UK Uh Liam Hillhurst,0.92,1.0
60,en-US,863.3199615999999,15.7200384,I think it's early I think it's Hilmar Yeah Olina Uh She goes on her screen names Alleen Vaud I think on Instagram She's really awesome And a lot of times I kind of know what I like and I'm sort of picking them for the styles that they're doing,0.93,1.0
61,en-US,879.0700032,11.3999872,Yeah And a lot of time a lot of these designers are basically making stuff and they're just sitting on it Yeah So a lot of times I'll just buy off them you know and mean a pretty like something like some design they mess,0.93,1.0
62,en-US,890.6500096,11.3399808,Yeah And then I'll either adjust it if if I'll take an element from it or I'll take the whole thing you know what I mean But I've basically just paid you know their commission fee on it and it works well,0.98,1.0
63,en-US,902.0199935999999,12.0200192,Yeah So then I don't know what the percentage Long story short Uh Uh I don't know Maybe maybe it's maybe it's almost 50/50 now I don't know So while back obviously you did all the design work Yeah I did yeah,0.99,1.0
64,en-US,914.6999807999999,12.750028799999999,When you started making that switch or you started buying illustration or at least hiring people like was that tough for you Like Uh to say like the kind of hand over the reins of the creative side No or no,0.97,1.0
65,en-US,927.4500095999999,17.279999999999998,It was actually kind of No not really It was it was a little bit of a relief A bit because I think it sort of brought a little bit of a a breath of fresh air into it because it just sort of sick of looking at despite the fact different ideas,0.97,1.0
66,en-US,945.0000384,17.1899904,It was cool to kind of just have a different interpretation Yeah You know what I mean Through someone you know you're still in essence other than what I mentioned about buying the prepackaged you're already you're are directing them Uh Um which I was used to when I was in the you know the traditional type role,0.97,1.0
67,en-US,962.259968,12.610047999999999,Yeah but Uh yeah No I I Uh I love it And at the time I I liked it a lot It kind of brought a brought a new sort of blood to it Yeah Life yeah Did it change the way you work too,0.94,1.0
68,en-US,974.8800511999999,12.8699392,Like I mean like that Like where now do you look at the stuff that you produce now and do you feel like it fits more into a box that the better Not a box but rather that that it fits more in line with what other people are producing,0.97,1.0
69,en-US,987.7499904,15.8900224,Or are you still doing your own thing your own way Mhm Or somewhere in the middle I mean sometimes because of what has happened to using like different styles all the kind of still all fits into the the the vibe of what we're doing,0.95,1.0
70,en-US,1003.6700159999999,16.049971199999998,Yeah Uh it just it just really pours No we're good OK well now we're going to pause Yeah I just passed out I was losing my train of thought No I think I think Um one of the challenges since I've decided to start using people it's been a few years since I've been using people,0.97,1.0
71,en-US,1020.3599872,15.2600576,Uh Sometimes I'm not sure if it's cohesive enough but it seems to be working Sometimes I kind of feel like we're a little bit too fragmented but you know Yeah But the tough thing is like it's a completely out of their conversation,0.98,1.0
72,en-US,1035.6200448,15.8399488,But I think you know it was all my style There's definitely people I or accounts that we sell to that just by my style And that's it Yeah And then there's other accounts that buy none of my style will buy some of the other illustrators that I buy and that kind of you know,0.96,1.0
73,en-US,1051.4599936,19.989913599999998,And so over time of who I've been using I kind of understood my customer a little bit more Um Um you know because it's also true I mean based on Uh like doing a lot of surf related stuff Uh you know I can't all be there is a lot of attraction to surf related stuff say in the Midwest,0.97,1.0
74,en-US,1071.4699776,8.280064,It's a harder sell for smaller stores unless you're like a Herley or a rip curl or something you know what I mean Like a smaller boutiques I'm going to buy my sort of stuff in the middle of the U.S.,0.95,1.0
75,en-US,1079.7800448,11.219968,Right Uh We just don't have the name for it Right So yeah Yeah And part of this is the reason I'm bringing this up is you know we talked about briefly about this new project I've got going on the tiger here media one,0.94,1.0
76,en-US,1091.069952,16.8800256,That's awesome Yeah The idea essentially is to create items that people designers or other creatives or even people who were not necessarily creative but have access to certain softwares Photoshop illustrator Adobe in design whatever can take the stuff that I do and make their own thing right,0.96,1.0
77,en-US,1107.9499776,14.3200256,I create a template They go out and do their own thing like a created a magazine template called Bug Out That's out now and it's 40 page template and somebody can go and take it Use the idea which is like more outdoorsy kind of survivalist type thing,0.95,1.0
78,en-US,1122.2900736,14.759936,Use that idea incorporate their own text their own images and go with it Or they can use just that blanket template and then go their own way to make whatever Right And that's just one thing But part of me is like thinking to myself like,0.96,1.0
79,en-US,1138.4599552,12.3000832,How do I know what people want Right Because this is kind of a new venture for me and it's like OK well do they need that kind of template I'm sure they do because they obviously they sound like we were talking about selling this stuff on creative market,0.99,1.0
80,en-US,1150.7600384,14.009958399999999,And it's one of the things that Uh that's up there and they're relatively popular That's one of the more like magazines or popular thing And I think a lot of people are very nostalgic about magazines like that They want to do a magazine,0.96,1.0
81,en-US,1165.4300672,11.459993599999999,I don't know how well they'll sell But it's not about me worried about how much they're going to sell It's about me just saying hey look here's here's your here's your bootstrapping opportunity to get into this template Go for it,1.0,1.0
82,en-US,1176.920064,18.8399616,Right Yeah I mean I like I think it's a great idea I think Um uh having the the templates is a great Uh thing for any designer I think Um the Photoshop brushes I think is great I think whether they're going to buy it or not I would probably just think about it the way that you think about what you,0.96,1.0
83,en-US,1195.7600255999998,15.5999232,would need Yeah You know what I mean Yeah Um and that's kind of the thing It's like I was thinking like OK well what what am I not seeing in the marketplace And I actually went and dug deep into the templates the magazine templates on creative market just to see what was there,0.98,1.0
84,en-US,1211.84,17.0999808,And again they're just in design templates So essentially they're all the same except for the fact that they have a different layout Right If you extract all of the images and all the text out of them they're essentially just blocks of blocks of pages of blocks,0.97,1.0
85,en-US,1229.32992,13.76,And so anyone can do the job of what you're looking to do It's just a matter of like what's esthetically going to get you out the gate And one of the things that I saw there is that it was all these really pretty things which is good,1.0,1.0
86,en-US,1243.6100096,14.2199808,Uh And you know some like kind of like very modern minimalistic style Like I can't think of the name of that magazine that like kind of started almost started that kicked off the magazine the minimalist magazine Oh wallpaper not wallpaper,0.98,1.0
87,en-US,1258.3699456,14.250086399999999,Now it's more it's more indeed And that starts with a K. It's about food and living and kind of lifestyle almost like a lifestyle blogger turned it into a magazine Uh Um I can't think of his call But anyway so I saw that happening a lot,0.93,1.0
88,en-US,1272.6500352,15.059968,Obviously it's popular but I thought well but nobody's doing this other thing and maybe it's maybe there doesn't need to be this other thing but Um it's something I think is missing from the marketplace So I'm going to put it out there and see you know worst case scenario it doesn't sell,0.99,1.0
89,en-US,1287.7400063999999,17.3299712,I can easily take that almost that exact same template replace the imagery with something that is more trendy or if I wanted to probably not going to do that but I could and immediately just put it out there as this new thing with new imagery and that maybe that'll be the selling point,0.98,1.0
90,en-US,1305.0799104,25.6800768,I mean Uh I'm looking over something new but Uh creative market like I bought a ton of Um different fonts and whatnot And the key for me from a purchasing Uh angle has always been Um obviously it's got the content going to be good whatever it is but then the cost Uh and you know like for the most part you know it's like,0.95,1.0
91,en-US,1330.7599871999998,14.1300736,twenty five bucks Yeah fifteen bucks Yeah my templates 39 Like I mean it's one of those things like if you're a designer really chugging out stuff that is such a small amount of money really at the end of the day when you're sort of valuing your productivity,0.97,1.0
92,en-US,1344.9499647999999,14.8200448,Yeah You know what I mean I mean just for example going back to what you were talking about with magazines Um and our magazine template you know back in the day when I was working Uh when I was an art director doing magazines a lot of inspiration,0.98,1.0
93,en-US,1359.7700095999999,20.729958399999997,You know we were always stockpiling magazines of every kind essentially to get you know photography inspiration get Layard inspiration And I Temperley isn't going to replace that You're always going to have that But I mean I can't even tell you the amount of hours I've probably spent looking to especially if you're cranking out a magazine trying to,0.97,1.0
94,en-US,1380.4999679999999,9.359974399999999,get OK like how am I going to lay this out You know I've I've exhausted every cent you know what I mean So I think all those resources are sort of invaluable and the cost is so cheap Yeah,0.96,1.0
95,en-US,1390.1899776,13.3199872,You know Yeah And that's kind of like being able to give somebody a foot in the door and whatever project is they want to do you know and even if like I've done I bought stuff on creative market too but because I like the idea of it was cool and then I didn't like it but it was,0.94,1.0
96,en-US,1403.5099648,12.179967999999999,a font Maybe I used it once Right And that's fine It did its purpose right It served its purpose And the cost was like I said twenty bucks Twenty five bucks Unless it's a really deep font with a bunch of weights and all that you know,0.96,1.0
97,en-US,1416.1700864,14.3199232,But Uh for the most part yeah I mean because I don't remember who I was talking to It was I talking to you about Oh no I was talking with a friend of mine about this font that we used on the magazine back in the day called Adell,0.97,1.0
98,en-US,1431.0500352,12.7899648,Okay And it's a sans serif No it's a serif font And it was kind of a little bit modernist but Uh fit Well with what we were doing and it was a thousand dollars and it had like I mean it had like 20 different weights,0.97,1.0
99,en-US,1443.8499328,13.260083199999999,Right But is a thousand dollars like buy it on like my phone Starcom or something Hoeveler or something like whoever put it out You know they I think it was an independent Uh I think it was a Um well it was a it was a smaller foundry,0.95,1.0
100,en-US,1457.1199488,10.670079999999999,Yeah But Uh that was one of the ones like there was like I think it was actually there was a European Uh team I don't remember what it was but it was just a couple thousand dollars But I wasn't paying for it,0.97,1.0
101,en-US,1467.8199296,17.5200256,Yeah my company paid for it so we could buy it because Because they didn't want to keep using like oh God OK another Bodoni another Garamond other Latino whatever you know like yeah whatever Uh Optima whatever It sucks when you look at stuff that you know how good it can look,0.96,1.0
102,en-US,1485.3399551999998,13.970124799999999,But because of things like you know you you know you have to have legitimately licensed fonts which everyone should have But when you're at a company is even now much more so Yeah Um Uh it just looks like garbage Yeah,0.97,1.0
103,en-US,1499.9200767999998,13.8599424,You know what I mean But you don't have a thousand bucks Right And you got to use like Bodoni Yeah Um yeah Yeah I mean don't get me wrong I love Bodoni I think it's I'm not encouraging Like non licensed Fonzie's,0.97,1.0
104,en-US,1513.959936,12.840140799999999,Right Right Yeah Don't the piracy We do not encourage piracy here on the Art Lessons podcast I had a I had something I was going to ask you but I just did It was Uh what was I going to ask you,0.96,1.0
105,en-US,1528.1200128,18.1799936,Oh you know that goes back to what I know I remember now Uh Uh is a similar kind of thought like with the Uh you know buying illustrations from designers you that they're pre done you No because at the end of the day I mean there's a lot Uh it's it's a bit of a crapshoot,0.95,1.0
106,en-US,1546.3600127999998,14.8200448,You know sometimes I've bought and stuff that you know to be honest has done nothing like hasn't done anything Um And then other stuff where it's paid for itself like a hundred times over Yeah You know so it's that kind of thing,0.97,1.0
107,en-US,1561.1800575999998,13.429964799999999,So it's kind of similarly like when you're OK well I'm going to buy a five for twenty five dollars I might I might use it once and get its value Or am I for twenty five dollars I mean you bought a you know a font that's going to be a staple of your repertoire for a long time,0.94,1.0
108,en-US,1574.6199551999998,15.270092799999999,Yeah Would you subscribe to the idea that the whole 80-20 rule like 20 percent of your of your illustrations that you buy or twenty percent of your purchases whether it's font illustrations whatever Pay for their eighty percent the rest of the eighty percent of the stuff that you,0.96,1.0
109,en-US,1590.2199808,19.109990399999997,I would say Uh I mean very it's rare You know it's an interesting thing is sometimes the stuff that may not sell Uh like in a season that I bought for may sell a year later Yeah You know Um I had a couple designs I did with Colin that did absolutely nothing,0.98,1.0
110,en-US,1610.3499775999999,13.890048,Uh One season we went to to to Magic and then the next one it just took off Took off Yeah I mean I had a I knew a good designer I knew was going to do well but I was kind of confused as to why I wasn't really doing well just a little ahead of its time,0.96,1.0
111,en-US,1624.5400576,17.129984,I mean we weren't reinventing the wheel or anything but it just I don't know the timing or something would just Yeah something wasn't right And it but it it came up later and it worked fine you know Have you ever killed off a design and then realized like oh shoot I should have I should have kept that,0.96,1.0
112,en-US,1641.6700415999999,18.059980799999998,on because then the trend came around to something similar Never really I mean the great thing about Uh the way it works in our shop is we can stockpile stuff and just don't really ever have to kill it unless it's something that's like you know where's the beef or something you know which we don't own obviously,0.98,1.0
113,en-US,1659.7300223999998,14.6199552,But if it was something similar Right You know what I mean Like um you know Yeah Uh Yeah I mean Uh I mean I mean when you say stockpile you mean stockpile Like you can have shirts available you don't necessarily have to print out,0.99,1.0
114,en-US,1674.3699456,13.860044799999999,No no no So at our shop because we we can we anything that's bigger screen printed anything that's small like resulta anti-government Um So we can you know we know we can sit on designer but we we need to print one of them,0.9,1.0
115,en-US,1688.2299904,11.940044799999999,We can print one of them You know it's not a big deal That's a great thing I love that That's kind of the same same credos as what Uh printing does Yeah You know Um it's a printing or print Full print full,0.93,1.0
116,en-US,1700.5300736,11.309875199999999,Well there's a couple There's print print print Uh It was print full is the one I use And then there's another one called print li or printed or something like that Yeah yeah That one's not I've heard that one's not as good,0.95,1.0
117,en-US,1711.8399488,17.390079999999998,Print is an excellent Yeah I think they're Chatsworth right They have a couple Yeah they started in Chatsworth They have another one Um um southeast coast somewhere I think or maybe in the south And then they just opened up another one in Europe so that they could do Uh you know that stuff without,0.97,1.0
118,en-US,1729.2400639999998,12.7899648,I think that's where they're from originally isn't it Or is the the founder I think from he's a European I think maybe Yeah maybe you know as good company though I mean they do good work And I just had an issue the other day where somebody bought one of my shirts it's one of the things I don't,0.95,1.0
119,en-US,1742.0300287999999,11.159961599999999,sell very often is shirts but somebody bought one of my shirts Actually what it was is they this is the beauty of it right I had a shirt design but it was on a unisex shirt And the woman said do you have these,0.98,1.0
120,en-US,1753.3700096,10.3800832,Can you do this on a woman's shirt I said yeah In fact I popped it I went back into print for the next opportunity I had which was later that day ran up a design you know like on their template,0.96,1.0
121,en-US,1763.7799936,13.1698688,Right And then put it up on a on the shop for her to buy She bought it She got it The design was a little off kilter like it wasn't quite centered And so she let me know she was totally Uh cordial about it,0.99,1.0
122,en-US,1776.9498624,11.860172799999999,And you know very Um accepting of or Well I apologize And she was like no don't worry about it but you know what can we do And I said let me look into it I contacted principal that day and they said oh we're sorry to hear about this,0.97,1.0

124,en-US,1799.1499775999998,14.840012799999998,And like no cost to me no cost to her And I've had a couple of incidences where that's happened where they like something got messed up or like a shipment like I shipped Uh a Uh mug to a friend in Trinidad and it never,0.99,1.0

128,en-US,1851.1699967999998,14.1299712,So like I sent this mug to Trinidad and it disappeared and they checked They waited a little bit to see what happened with it And the the the girl Oh and a power sprayer Beautiful That's why it's not a lawnmower,0.97,1.0
129,en-US,1865.2999679999998,13.560012799999999,It's a power sprayer Awesome That's great for my equipment too So we might have to sign this one off soon But anyway so they didn't find it And so they just sent her a new one and then they came back,0.99,1.0
130,en-US,1878.8599808,9.3298688,So she got two mugs and they were like whatever Yeah You know they said don't even worry about sending it back Just keep it right And it was just like that's bitted right I mean I hope that doesn't happen a lot,0.96,1.0
131,en-US,1888.5500928,9.6598016,I mean it hasn't happened a lot but it when it did happen they took care of it And that's that's that's a sign of a great company Yeah I'm going to be loyal to see the problem with I can't,0.98,1.0
132,en-US,1898.2701055999999,13.709926399999999,I would love Well we had the same situation like we have it built into our warehouse like you know the machines they're using But we can I couldn't do wholesale using them Yeah They're just not the way that they're they're pricing structure,0.93,1.0
133,en-US,1911.980032,20.339916799999997,Is it just it when Yeah Like it's great for direct to consumer Uh Um Exactly They do neck labels on your shirt They do now They do yeah But uncertain only on certain shirts Um Wait till they do them Yeah I think they do because that was my other thing too I can like I would need to have a neck,0.94,1.0

135,en-US,1946.3198719999998,11.0401536,Yeah I can't remember how it works but yeah basically there are certain ones but obviously every time you put something yeah it's to cost because Kaskaskia a little bit going on and they're paying you know the price on per shirt is obviously higher,0.89,1.0
136,en-US,1957.3899264,15.0300672,Yeah So direct to consumer it might be It's great for direct to consumer I Yeah I mean what are the places that does Uh some of our larger volume screen printing is doing some direct to garment and you know we'll see what happens in the future,0.96,1.0
137,en-US,1972.7499263999998,21.1802112,I mean as the markets kind of going where it's going Bower's Premiere hours make Um it a you know I'm always looking at ways that I can kind of reduce my overhead Yeah You know and Um yeah maybe the days of having Uh a warehouse and in in the next year or so might might not exist you know we might,0.94,1.0
138,en-US,1993.9301375999999,11.3399808,get rid of that Yeah I mean obviously your margin is higher You know it is But but you know it's a real it's a real dance of Um Um I mean your margin is smaller I guess you could say Right,0.99,1.0
139,en-US,2005.2701184,12.1499648,Your margin is smaller on that because your cost to produce it is higher and your than your retail Are you saying if we outsource that Yeah if you outsource If we outsource it yes But then So here's where it gets like,0.96,1.0
140,en-US,2018.76992,20.140031999999998,So for example Um there's a few stream printers we use that do full package for us You know what I mean And Um you know they're doing like three four Seven eight ten thousand pieces you know all bad Now if I brought it to another screen Premiere who wouldn't do a full package would scream print it for us,0.94,1.0
141,en-US,2039.2400896,16.709836799999998,We could probably save a little bit of money But the amount we're saving versus what we're getting it's just not worth it So it's funny Sometimes you can get kind of fooled into thinking that well if I take all this on board I'm going to save X amount of dollars you know what I mean,1.0,1.0
142,en-US,2055.9599616,18.3801856,But yeah sometimes taking it on isn't worth the savings Yeah You know what I mean Right So that's what I'm kind of struggling with as I'm struggling with the Uh finding someone good because there's always some technical parameters to outsource like smaller run units like in Internet and stuff like that,0.98,1.0
143,en-US,2075.639808,11.780096,Um Um But Uh yeah I love to not have our space We've had our space our Uh little space for like five years I'd love to get rid of it in a year if I could Yeah Back to the whole Khloe Kardashian or whatever,0.97,1.0

146,en-US,2116.8400383999997,15.6899328,I've had great people Yeah but even then sometimes it's just you know I'm not a very good manager Uh Um But Uh basically what I'm saying sometimes is when you start delegating delegating actually can cost you money too Yeah Um Um it's just yeah,0.98,1.0

187,en-US,2695.9298559999997,16.3702784,I think as a as a business owner you're always spending money to make money And I'm fine with that But I think over time as I've watched the market erode a little bit in places I'm just I'm I'm having a harder time wanting to do that,0.99,1.0
188,en-US,2712.3099647999998,12.3000832,Yeah So is in terms of a contingency you know I didn't do the show in in uh in March or excuse me February it was just email my accounts I had some drop out and we talked about this last time,0.97,1.0
189,en-US,2724.9698816,14.5502208,Nothing massively significant This show you know it's a lot of my Japanese accounts some are going to come see me in Costa Mesa and I'll be fine There is really no plan because I don't know other than what I've done what could happen,1.0,1.0
190,en-US,2739.879936,15.509913599999999,But I do know I don't have enough money to continue putting that out and hoping it will come back when you when you notice the market's coming is going down Yeah You know what I mean Like it's something has to has to give a little bit you know,0.98,1.0
191,en-US,2755.7500928,16.9498624,Have you ever considered diversification in what you're providing Like I say I mean there's some you know like not necessarily like Garment's to HomeGoods or something like that but something completely different Like what Like does the poster list stand for anything more,0.97,1.0
192,en-US,2772.7300608,21.709823999999998,Like we talked about like me doing creative market You like creative market You also personally were saying maybe putting some of your your photos up there Yeah just a as a stock imagery or whatnot Like is there something else or in that vein or that you know that you considered or maybe could consider diversifying into to under,0.98,1.0
193,en-US,2794.44992,17.1300864,the brand or just something totally different No Under the brand Uh I don't I don't know I mean people see a lot of my my competitors who are doing stuff have and it's always been assigned to me that Um they've had to because of where the market is,0.99,1.0
194,en-US,2811.5800064,16.2902016,So for example like a lot of my my competitors are friends with the who are on magic T-shirt brands You know they're rolling out socks you know they're rolling out mugs they're rolling out everything And I get it,0.96,1.0
195,en-US,2828.5300736,16.979968,But for me personally like I I don't know I find it it just becomes at least when you're trying to you know in my case shelve it like put it in a warehouse and everything else it just makes it that much more fragmented,0.99,1.0

199,en-US,2890.4298495999997,17.8200576,and then sort of cut some of that down So In my case it was like OK well I'm spending about Um Um you know twenty five to twenty six thousand dollars a year on on trade shows I'm getting the money back but I'm not really getting like I'm getting all the money back and then some obviously but I'm not,0.98,1.0
200,en-US,2908.2499072,16.560128,really gaining any new accounts What's the point of me really being there Yeah well you just fosler the accounts you have Kaina Yeah And save twenty five Twenty six thousand bucks Yeah I was I just got done reading Phil Knight's book Uh the founder of Nike,0.95,1.0

203,en-US,2956.290048,17.669939199999998,but he struggled all the way up until like probably the 90s But he wasn't until he really connected with like the NBA and things like that that he really started to like build something And he was even even in that point he was just like he was always leveraging leveraging leveraging leveraging to grow the brand,0.99,1.0
204,en-US,2973.9599872,15.3901056,And now obviously Nike is the most popular fitness brand in the world And it started from a couple of shoes like they even they even originally started selling on Atsuko Brand like they didn't even have their own shoes it until like deep into the 70s,0.97,1.0
205,en-US,2989.7500671999996,18.8399616,Right So they weren't even a real shoemaker until until that point But so it was interesting to hear that story and watch him like stick to a certain amount of stuff for a certain amount of point and just leverage until he could grow those like whatever was handful of handful of styles into something,1.0,1.0
206,en-US,3008.5900288,8.9700352,And I can remember them All right like back in the day like the ones that people saw you know the red and white ones or the white and blue ones with the leather and And so yeah it's interesting,0.97,1.0

208,en-US,3030.7299328,16.2299904,Pretty much Yeah it's like Nike stuff with Herley Brands written on it you know And of course Hurley is still attached to the surf skate world Like they they I mean that's right That's why Nike got them so that they could have an arm in that because they tried to get in there themselves and they just didn't,0.97,1.0
